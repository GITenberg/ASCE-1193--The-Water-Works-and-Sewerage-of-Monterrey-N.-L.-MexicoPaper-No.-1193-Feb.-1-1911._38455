<p>Monterrey, the Capital of the State of Nuevo León, Mexico, is built on
the site of the old village of Santa Lucía de León, which was
established in 1583 by the Governor of the Kingdom of León, Don Luis
Carabajal. Four years later Carabajal was imprisoned by the Inquisition,
and the village of Santa Lucía was abandoned by its few inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 1596, Captain Diego Montemayor, a resident of Saltillo, in the
adjoining State, wishing to render a service to his king, Philip II of
Spain, assembled his friends, and on September 20th of that year,
proceeded to establish a town on the site of the old village on the
northern side of the principal spring at the place. The town was named
"Nuestra Señora de Monterrey" (Our Lady of Monterrey), after the Count
of Monterrey (Ojos de Santa Lucía y Valle de Extremadura), the ruling
Governor of New Spain, as Mexico was then called.</p>
<!--476.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span></p>
<p>Monterrey is approximately in the center of the State of Nuevo León, 1°
12´ west of Mexico City, and in latitude 26° 40´ N. It is a distributing
railway center on the main line of the National Railroad, 270 km. from
the Rio Grande at Laredo, 1,022 km. from Mexico, and 520 km. from
Tampico by the Mexican Central Railway. It is the center of many large
industries, and is the second largest manufacturing city in the
Republic.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="The_Concession" id="The_Concession"></a>The Concession.</span></h2>

<p>The works described in this paper were carried out under a guaranteed
concession granted by His Excellency, General Bernardo Reyes, Governor
of the State of Nuevo León, to Messrs. James D. Stocker and William
Walker, of Scranton, Pa. The concession is dated October 19th, 1904, and
is for 99 years from that date; the works for a complete water and
drainage system were to be finished in 3 years from the time of their
commencement. Before the works were designed and begun, the concession
was acquired by Mr. William Mackenzie, of the firm of Mackenzie, Mann
and Company, Limited, of Toronto, Ont., Canada, who, on May 4th, 1906,
organized the Monterrey Water-Works and Sewerage Company, Limited
(Compañía de Servicio de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey, S. A.), under the
laws of the Dominion of Canada, of which company he is President. Mr.
Mackenzie is also President of the Monterrey Railway, Light, and Power
Company, Limited, which was constructing the street railways of
Monterrey concurrently with the water-works. Under the provisions of the
concession, the Government appointed a Financial Interventor, who had
authority to examine and check the company's expenditures, and also a
Technical Inspector to examine and report on the construction. The
duties of these officials also apply to the operation of the system when
the construction is finished. The Government has the right, after the
system has been operated 40 years, to purchase the entire property,
subject to 6 months' notice, for a sum equal to 16<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> times the average
annual net proceeds during the 3 preceding years. This right may be
exercised at the end of 40 years, or at the end of any 10-year period
thereafter, up to 99 years from the commencement of operations.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Geology_and_Topography" id="Geology_and_Topography"></a>Geology and Topography.</span></h2>

<p>Monterrey lies in a plain at the foot of the Eastern Sierra Madre
Mountains which constitute the eastern margin of the Mexican Cordilleran
<!--477.png--><span class="pagenum">477</span>Plateau,
and is surrounded by the magnificent mountains of that group,
among the most notable of which are the beautiful Mitra and Silla
Mountains. In the neighborhood of Monterrey these mountains attain
heights of from 2,000 to 2,400 m., and are noted for their broken and
jagged sky-lines. The leading geological characteristics of the district
are the uplifted limestones of the older cretaceous age which form the
main mass of the mountains.</p>

<p>Primarily, the mountains are compressional folds which, in the Sierra
Madre, near Monterrey, are close and vertically compressed.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
drainage areas of the Santa Catarina River, which flows through
Monterrey, and of the Estanzuela and Silla Rivers, its tributaries, are
of limestone and shale; originally the shales were above the limestone,
but the convulsion which formed the Sierra Madre as an anticlinal fold,
left the originally horizontal strata standing nearly upright, and
subsequent erosion in the upper part of the anticline has exposed nearly
vertical strata in many places. The limestone being hard and resisting
erosion, there is generally, along the line of contact, an abrupt drop
vertically on the face of the limestone to the shale below. In many
places this abrupt drop is broken by a limestone talus, but the line of
contact can generally be traced. Mining operations in these mountains
have revealed the presence of large caves at a considerable elevation,
many of which contain large reservoirs of water, delivered to them
through numerous faults. The river valleys are formed of masses of
limestone conglomerate and coarse gravels, re-cemented in many cases by
the lime deposits of the flowing waters. One of the chief
characteristics of the subsoil of Monterrey itself is a local rock
called "sillar," which is a superficial deposit of carbonate of lime
from the evaporated waters. In some places the "sillar" is largely mixed
with a conglomerate called "tepetate," or "impure sillar."</p>

<p>Topographically, the region around Monterrey is distinguished by the
drainage area of the River Santa Catarina, which rises in the Sierra
Madre near the Laguna de Sanchez, at an elevation of 1,850 m., as shown
on <a href="#p02">Plate II</a>. From this Laguna it follows a tortuous
course between precipitous mountains through the Boca of Santa Catarina
to Monterrey, for a distance of 90 km., eventually finding
<!--478.png--><span class="pagenum">478</span>its way to
the San Juan River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. Throughout its course
it disappears, flows underground, and again appears; and, except in
flood time, it has a subsurface flow for a distance of 16 km. above the
city. In the Cañon of Santa Catarina it appears at the surface, having a
normal flow of about 1,415 liters (50 cu. ft.) per sec., and its waters
at that point are divided into two parts and carried into irrigation
canals. The drainage area of the river above Monterrey is 1,410 sq. km.,
and its bed at Monterrey is between 518 and 545 m. above sea level.</p>

<p>Southward from Monterrey the country rises along the valley of the Silla
for a distance of 19 km., where the Silla is separated from the San Juan
by a low divide, the former flowing northward to Monterrey and the
latter southeastward toward Allende. The Silla Valley is bounded on the
east and west by the steep ranges of the Silla and Sierra Madre
Mountains. The floor of this valley is gently rolling, but is cut by
many arroyos which carry little or no water during the greater part of
the year. The chief feeder of the Silla River is the Estanzuela, a
stream which derives its waters from several springs coming to the
surface near the line of contact between the limestone and the shale, at
elevations of about 800 and 900 m.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> above datum. The water-shed of
this stream is rich with abundant vegetation due to the precipitation
being greater than on the Santa Catarina water-shed. To the south of the
divide the country is well wooded, and El Porvenir, 35 km. from
Monterrey, is the garden spot of the State of Nuevo León. Here the
rainfall is much greater than at any other point near Monterrey, and
there are many streams which are used for irrigation purposes. Monterrey
is built on a plain, chiefly on the north side of the Santa Catarina
River. This plain has a general fall toward the northeast, and beyond
the city it slopes gently northward for several miles toward the Topo
Grande River, and then southeastward to join the great coastal plain of
the Gulf of Mexico. The general elevation of the city lies between the
519- and 550-m. contours. The Plaza Zaragoza, in the center of the city,
is 533.90 m. above sea level; the elevation of the highest part of the
city, at the western boundary, is 550.05 m., and of the lowest part, at
the northeastern boundary, 518.0 m. above sea level.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label">[4]</span> Excluding deaths due to drowning in the great flood of
August 27th and 28th.</div>

<p>Table 1 gives particulars of the death rate for 1901 to 1909, inclusive,
and data relative to the mortality due to typhoid fever. The high death
rate is caused by the excessive infantile mortality, which is so
prevalent throughout the whole of Mexico. The climatic condition of
Monterrey, with its exceptionally healthy subsoil, ought to make it one
of the healthiest of cities, if proper care were taken to enforce
sanitary laws. The data regarding typhoid mortality are probably
<!--482.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
understated, as they were compiled by the writer, in the absence of any
official publications, from the actual death certificates, but no
special care is taken by the authorities to insure accuracy in such
certificates. Attention is called to the typhoid rate in May, June,
July, and August, 1909; this high rate coincides with a scarcity of
rainfall and the greatest period of drought experienced in 30 years, and
immediately precedes the great flood of August 27th. It was probably due
to the lowering of the ground-water throughout the city and the
consequent contamination of the private wells, which were largely in use
during that time. Throughout the city the wells are sunk to a depth of
about 12 or 15 m., in order to reach the subterranean waters, and the
cesspools are often in dangerous proximity to them and at a much higher
level. The nature of the subsoil, which is often much fissured and open
in the conglomerate and sillar strata, would make the passage of
contamination an easy matter, and this alone would account for a high
mortality due to water-borne diseases.</p>

<p>The precipitation records of Monterrey and its neighborhood are very
meager, and cannot be relied on for a longer period than from 1894 to
1909, inclusive. The records are available from 1886, but in the early
years there are many apparent discrepancies, and they are probably
inaccurate. The average rainfall for the 15 years (1894-1908) is 21.94
in.; the driest years for this period are as follows: 1894, 14.14 in.;
1902, 15.29 in.; 1907, 15.23 in.; 1908, 15.11 in. Assuming the early
records to be correct, the average rainfall for the period, 1886-1908,
would be 19.86 in.</p>

<p>At Saltillo, which is 50 miles due southwest, at an elevation of about
1,520 m. above sea level, the average rainfall for the 23 years,
1884-1908, inclusive, is given as 21 in. The maximum year was 1889, with
33<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in., and the minimum 1903, with
7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.</p>

<p>At Carmen, in the State of Tamaulipas, 144 km. southwest of Monterrey,
at an elevation of about 310 m. above sea level, the average fall for 12
years is 24.70 in., the maximum year being 1897, with a fall of 34.09
in., and the minimum year, 1905, with 13.41 in.</p>

1894-1909. Fig. 2 shows the monthly variation during the same period,
and gives the minimum, average, and maximum for each month.
<!--485.png--><span class="pagenum">481</span>
From these
diagrams it will be seen that the months of least rainfall are December,
January, February, and March, with averages of 0.66, 0.59, 0.79, and
0.93 in., respectively. The months of greatest rainfall are August, with
an average of 4.39 in., and September with 4.87 in. The maximum in any
month prior to 1909 was 16.75 in., during September, 1904.</p>

<p><i>Rainfall in 1909.</i>&mdash;The rainfall in 1909 was unprecedented, causing the
disastrous flood in the Santa Catarina River, which will be referred to
when describing the works. Fig. 3 shows the monthly rainfall for 1906 to
1909, inclusive, and has been plotted to show the variation of rainfall
prior to the great precipitation of August, 1909. In that month there
were two heavy falls, one beginning at midnight on August 9th, and
during the following 42 hours a fall of 13.28 in. was recorded by the
gauge at the Water-Works Company's general offices, 10.20 in. of which
fell, during the first 24 hours. From 6 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> to 11 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, on August
10th, 5.019 in. were recorded, or an average of 1 in. per hour.</p>

falling in 24 hours.</p>

<p>The total precipitation during the month amounted to 36.00 in. The
highest previous record for the month of August was in 1895, with a fall

August. As no automatic recording gauge was available,
<!--488.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
the maximum
intensity could only be computed approximately, owing to the
intermittent character of the readings taken from the ordinary rain
gauge on the roof of the Water-Works Company's office in the city. From
the readings thus obtained, it was shown that the maximum intensity
occurred early on the morning of the 28th, and was nearly 2 in. per
hour. Above Monterrey, in the Santa Catarina water-shed, it is believed
that the precipitation was considerably greater, but no gauges were
accessible during the month.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Available_Sources_of_Supply" id="Available_Sources_of_Supply"></a>Available Sources of Supply.</span></h2>

<p>The question of the best sources from which Monterrey should be supplied
with potable water was one that had been long under discussion, and was
the subject of many investigations prior to the granting of the present
concession. Several of the original schemes called for an impounding
reservoir in the Cañon of Santa Catarina and it was on the assumption
that a dam would be built that a clause was inserted in the concession
for the purpose of making its construction obligatory. The general
character of the physical and geological conditions surrounding
Monterrey has already been referred to. A thorough study of these
conditions proved that no suitable site for impounding the Santa
Catarina River could be found, apart from the fact that periodically
this river is subject to enormous floods which tear through the steep
cañon with tremendous velocity.</p>

<p>At the site originally proposed for the dam, a considerable underflow
was found, and later investigations, carried out under the present
concession, proved that, although borings were carried to a depth of 54
m., bed-rock could not be found, the strata being composed of gravels,
conglomerate and sand. Assuming that such a dam could
<!--490.png--><span class="pagenum">486</span>
have been built,
the quality of the water draining from a comparatively barren
water-shed, on which many thousands of goats are pastured, would have
made its filtration an absolute necessity before it could be delivered
to the consumers.</p>

<p>The various available sources from which water could be delivered to the
city by gravity were investigated by Mr. F. S. Hyde, in the autumn of
1905, and also by J. D. Schuyler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., who was afterward
retained as Consulting Engineer for the Company. The various
investigations made from time to time showed that the question of a
satisfactory supply was one of extreme difficulty, requiring prolonged
observation and study, more particularly into the character of the
underground sources of supply.</p>

<p>One of the chief characteristics of many of the streams in the State of
Nuevo León, is their disappearance and reappearance at different points
along their routes, and the Santa Catarina River, under normal
conditions, as already remarked, is a very notable example of a river
which is very dry at the surface for many kilometers of its length. In
the writer's opinion, the waters of this and similar rivers in the State
pass through many open caverns underground, so that experience gained in
the investigation of underflow waters in other places would be
insufficient to determine the quantity passing at any point along the
river if ascertained by merely computing it from the velocity of the
underflow and the area of the water-bearing gravels. The rainfall on the
water-shed of the Santa Catarina River is probably 25% greater than at
Monterrey, and all ordinary rains sink rapidly into the limestone soils
and quickly disappear. In another water-shed of a very similar
character, namely, that of the Rio Blanco, in the southern part of the
State, the underflow waters appear at the surface at a place called
Mezquital, where a metamorphosed sandstone barrier prevents them from
disappearing underground. At this point the normal quantity of water is
about 5,660 liters (200 cu. ft.) per sec., but it gradually disappears,
and a few kilometers below it has sunk to an insignificant stream,
finally disappearing altogether for about 20 km. In the neighborhood of
Monterrey similar conditions exist with regard to the surface-water
supplies, and investigations, therefore, were directed toward obtaining
unpolluted supplies from springs and underground sources.</p>

<p><i>Santa Catarina Sources.</i>&mdash;The chief points from which it was
<!--494.png--><span class="pagenum">488</span>
thought
desirable to obtain underflow supplies were (1) at the barrier of San
Geronimo, and (2) at the Cañon of Santa Catarina, both shown on
<a href="#p02">Plate II</a>.</p>

<p>Conditions at San Geronimo, which is only 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> km. west of Monterrey,
were investigated by the State Government in 1892, to determine the
depth of bed-rock, the rock on either side of the valley being shale,
with its original bedding planes standing almost vertical. To determine
this depth, borings were made by driving 2-in. tubes until it was
assumed that bed-rock had been reached, a method which, in strata
containing so many boulders, was obviously unreliable. These borings
indicated that bed-rock was from 12 to 15 m. below the surface. If these
had proved to be correct, there is no doubt that a development of the
underground water at this point, by constructing a submerged dam
combined with an infiltration gallery, would have yielded a large
supply.</p>

<p>In March, 1906, the Company commenced operations at San Geronimo by
sinking a well a few meters north of the then dry bed of the river.
Water was found in considerable quantities a few meters below the
surface, practically at the level of the river, that is, 570 m. above
datum. This supply was used for provisional purposes, and will be
referred to later in describing the San Geronimo gravity supply works.</p>

<p>Between August, 1906, and January, 1907, 4-in. bore-holes were sunk in
the river bed and on the high ground to the north with a "Keystone"
driller outfit. These borings showed bed-rock immediately under the
river bed, at a depth of from 15 to 45 m., but dipping gradually as the
borings were carried northward.</p>

<p>Boring operations were also carried on at Santa Catarina, during
November and December, 1906, and in January, 1907, to determine the
geological conditions, and the results are shown on <a href="#i489">Fig. 7</a>. From the
area of water-bearing gravels found, it was proposed to tap the
underflow water at the 630-m. level by an infiltration gallery. This
would have necessitated a gravitation tunnel 3,000 m. long, and an
aqueduct of 14 km., which it was proposed to carry to one of two
distributing reservoirs at Guadalupe, on the south side of the river,
opposite Monterrey. In May, 1907, the writer, after making a study of
all the available data which had been accumulated, had additional
borings sunk farther across the valley to the north, and these revealed
a considerable area of water-bearing gravels, and proved that, in former
<!--495.png--><span class="pagenum">489</span>
geological times, the Santa Catarina flowed about 500 m. north of its
present position, and to the back of Obispado Mountain, instead of
through the city. This aspect of the subject was discussed with Mr.
Schuyler, who agreed with the writer that, in the interest of economy,
it was better to tap this supply by an infiltration gallery at the
560-m. level, and bring the water thus obtained to a reservoir to be
placed at the western limits of the city, dividing the city, for
distribution purposes, into two interchangeable systems, a high- and a
low-pressure, the high-pressure system being supplied from Estanzuela,
18 km. south of the city. One advantage to be gained from this change
was that the scheme was capable of considerable extension, and any
future developments at Santa Catarina Cañon would form part of the works
to be constructed for both high- and low-pressure districts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><a name="i489" id="i489"></a>
<img src="images/i489.jpg" width="700" height="594" alt="Fig. 7." title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.&mdash;Cross-section Of Santa Catarina River At
Santa Catarina.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The future extension of the Santa Catarina sources, the writer believes,
can be developed best by driving an infiltration gallery 10 m. below the
surface of the Santa Catarina River, a little west of the village of the
same name, and then conveying the water through a comparatively
<!--496.png--><span class="pagenum">490</span>short
gravitation tunnel and pressure conduit to a main reservoir near San
Geronimo having a top water level at an elevation of about 590 m. above
datum.</p>

<p><i>Southern Sources of Supply.</i>&mdash;The available sources of supply southward
from Monterrey include a number of springs at various points in a
distance of 40 km. Many of these springs are of uncertain quantity, and
some are quite dry during periods of drought. The chief perennial
springs near Monterrey are those which contribute to form the Estanzuela
and Diente Rivers, both tributaries of the Silla, while farther south,
at the Potrero Cerna, near El Porvenir, there are excellent springs, at
a considerable elevation, with a minimum flow of from 170 to 200 liters
(from 6 to 7 cu. ft.) per sec. The total quantity of water available
from all these springs during the driest season would probably not be
less than about 560 or 700 liters (from 20 to 25 cu. ft.) per sec.</p>

<p>The Estanzuela springs issue at the foot of the Sierra Madre Mountains,
and have a normal flow of from 56 to 85 liters (2 to 3 cu. ft.) per sec.
in an ordinary dry year; they probably derive their water, through the
limestone formation, from the neighboring water-shed of Santa Catarina,
as the catchment area of the stream is only 910 hectares, and the stream
has never been known to fail, even in the driest periods of prolonged
drought. The rainfall on the area is about 30 in. per annum, and the
catchment area is well wooded and covered with abundant vegetation. The
El Diente springs have an ordinary dry-weather flow of about 28<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
liters (1 cu. ft.) per sec.; but part of the water is carried
underground, and the real quantity is much greater and could be
developed by a small submerged dam carried down to bed-rock.</p>

<p>The elevation and the extreme purity of the water of the Estanzuela
River made its acquisition very desirable, and the Company, therefore,
purchased the Federal water rights owned by various members of the
Estanzuela community, amounting to 91 liters per sec., and has since
acquired a Federal concession to all the flood-waters of that river. It
was decided, therefore, to adopt the Estanzuela River as the first step
toward developing the water to the south of Monterrey for a
high-pressure supply, the advantage of the scheme being that from time
to time extensions could be made to tap other sources by gravity, as the
demands of the city required. The Estanzuela scheme, therefore,
<!--497.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
is a
preliminary step toward future extensions which will be necessary in
this direction as the city grows. The springs near El Porvenir, and
others which contribute to the San Juan River, can be tapped at a
sufficiently high level to convey them by a gravity pressure line to the
Estanzuela Aqueduct near Mederos.</p>

<p>The two sources definitely decided on in July, 1907, were those from
Estanzuela and San Geronimo. The works were designed to supply
40,000,000 liters daily, which it was assumed would be sufficient for
all future developments for a population of 200,000 at a per capita
consumption of 200 liters per day. The present requirements of the
city's population, assuming that all the water was supplied by the
Company, would be, at that rate, which is a very liberal one, only
18,000,000 liters daily. This, it was thought, would be easily met by
the San Geronimo source alone, as it was estimated that it would provide
not less than 20,000,000 liters, if the infiltration gallery was driven
far enough into the water-bearing gravels.</p>

<p>The question of a high-pressure water supply for domestic use in a city
like Monterrey is not a serious one, as practically nine-tenths of the
houses are of one story. The increase in the number of large commercial
buildings, however, will make the demand greater in the future, and this
point has been kept in mind in arranging the division of the
distribution systems.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Materials_for_Concrete" id="Materials_for_Concrete"></a>Materials for Concrete.</span></h2>

<p><i>Cement.</i>&mdash;In the early stages of construction the cement for the work
was obtained from the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, Limited,
of London, which supplied the "Pyramid" brand, from the Knight, Bevan,
and Sturges Works, but later the supply was obtained from a new factory
at Hidalgo, near Monterrey. The total quantity of Portland cement used
was 42,500 bbl. of "Pyramid" and 32,500 bbl. of "Hidalgo." The English
cement was tested for the Water-Works Company in London before shipment
and again at Monterrey, to conform to the British Standard
Specifications; the "Hidalgo" cement was required to pass the Standard
Specifications advocated by the Special Committee of the American
Society of Civil Engineers. The quality in each case was of the very
highest, no difficulties being experienced at any time.</p>
<!--498.png--><p><span class="pagenum">492</span></p>

<p><i>Sand and Rock.</i>&mdash;One of the chief difficulties in connection with the
construction work in its initial stages was in procuring satisfactory
sand for the concrete. An investigation of the quality of all the
available sands in the neighborhood of Monterrey resulted in the
decision to use a manufactured sand obtained from the calcareous shales
in the foot-hills opposite the city, on the south side, and near the
site of one of the proposed reservoirs. A quarry was opened, and the raw
material was delivered by a gravity plane to a crushing plant, 230 m.
from the quarry and at a level about 50 m. lower.</p>

<p>The plant consisted of a No. 5 Austin gyratory rock-crusher, fitted with
elevators and revolving screens of various dimensions, driven by a
150-h.p. Erie steam engine; two sets of Traylor's heavy-duty crushing
rolls, one having 30 by 16-in. and the other 18 by 12-in. rolls; and a
Niagara sand disintegrator. This plant, except during a short period
when the requirements were beyond its capacity, was able to produce all
the sand and rock required for construction purposes. More than 40,000
tons of rock were quarried, the greater part of which was converted into
crushed stone and sand.</p>

<p>The chief sands used for ordinary building purposes in Monterrey are
Nos. 10 and 11, which are procured from the bed of the Santa Catarina
River. As these sands contain large proportions of lime carbonates,
which make them very undesirable for important structures, their use was
limited to relatively unimportant work. The best sands procurable were
Nos. 5 and 9, but the long distance of the pits from Monterrey, and
consequently the heavy freight rate, made their use prohibitive on
economical grounds. The best of the available sands, although it was
very fine, was No. 7, from Hornos, near Torreon, as it could be depended
on for uniformity and could be obtained f. o. b. cars at Monterrey for
3.18<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> pesos per ton.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> All costs given in this paper are in Mexican pesos, one
peso being equivalent to 50 cents in U. S. currency.</div>

<p>The bulk of the sand and crushed rock used was similar to Nos. 12 and
13, and reference to the cement sand tests in Table 3, will show that
the manufactured sands gave very satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Table 3 gives the average tests made with the "Hidalgo" cement and
various sands, alone and in combination, for the purpose of obtaining
comparative results; the mixtures tested were composed of 3 parts of
sand to 1 of cement.</p>

<p>The Hornos sand was used during a few weeks in the latter part of 1908,
when the crusher was unable to produce all that was required. Its use
was restricted to thick walls which were required to be water-tight, and
it was always used in equal proportions with the crusher dust.</p>

<a href="images/i495.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p><i>Intake Works.</i>&mdash;The intake (Fig. 8) is about 1 km. below the lowest
spring and at a point where the maximum flow of the stream was observed.
The works consist of a small monolithic concrete dam, placed obliquely
across the stream at an angle selected for the purpose of obtaining a
foundation running parallel to the direction of the strata, which at
this point were lying almost vertically across the bed of the stream.
Above these strata the stream bed was formed chiefly of large cemented
limestone blocks and smaller conglomerate. No storage being possible in
this valley, which has a very precipitous fall, the height of the dam
was fixed merely to obtain a small settling basin for sand and débris
brought down in time of flood. The dam foundation was excavated to
bed-rock, from which the upper disintegrated portions were carefully
removed; the rock was then stepped, and dovetailed recesses were left
for properly bonding the concrete.</p>

<p>The dam is carried well into the banks. Its extreme length is 52 m., its
maximum height 4.50 m., and its greatest thickness 2 m. The up-stream
face has a batter of 1 in 12, and the down-stream face, 1 in 8. The top
of the wall is 1 m. thick. For the discharge of flood-water there is a
weir 10 m. long, and it was calculated that with a depth of 1 m. it
would discharge about 400 times the ordinary flow, or about 23,000
liters per sec., but, in addition, the whole length of the dam
(excluding that occupied by the gate-house) was arranged for the
discharge of abnormal floods, one of which, on August 27th, reached the
enormous quantity of 82,070 liters (2,900 cu. ft.) per sec., or 825 cu.
ft. per sec. per sq. mile of drainage area, a remarkable run-off from so
small an area as 910 hectares. The concrete forming the dam is a 1:3:5
mixture. The overflow sill is 692 m. above sea level. When the dam was
completed it was filled to the overflow level, in order to test the
water-tightness of the basin, which, when cleared, was found to be
slightly fissured on the north side. The leakage was sufficient to cause
a serious loss during periods of drought, and it was then decided to
line the basin with concrete, so that the stream would enter it without
being under a head greater than its own depth. The length of the basin,
measured along the center line of the original stream surface, is 85 m.,
and its area is 1,100 sq. m. At its upper end it is merely a lined
channel, 5 m. wide at the entrance. The floor of the basin has a fall of
4 m. The lining was formed in
<!--504.png--><span class="pagenum">496</span>two
thicknesses totaling 30.5 cm. (12
in.) of 1:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
concrete, laid in panels approximately 3 m.
square, the upper panels breaking joint with those immediately below; in
this way a very satisfactory and water-tight lining was obtained. A
parapet wall, 45.7 cm. high, surrounds the basin. For scouring out the
basin a 30.5-cm. (12-in.) cast-iron pipe was taken through the dam at
the lowest point, this pipe being provided with a gate-valve encased in
concrete on the down-stream face.</p>

<p>The gate-house was built in connection with the dam at the north end of
the overflow weir, its inner dimensions being 4.34 by 2.80 m. The
substructure, to the level of the dam, is of concrete founded on the
solid rock, and the superstructure is of brick rendered with cement
plaster. The roof is of framed timber with red French tiles.</p>

<p>The intake pipe is of cast iron. 40.6 cm. (16 in.) in internal diameter,
fitted outside with a movable copper screen which is further protected
by a wrought-iron hinged screen to prevent damage from stones, floating
timber, etc., during times of flood. Inside the gate-house the outlet
pipe is provided with a 40.6-cm. (16-in.) sluice-valve, operated from
the floor level by a vertical head-stock with worm-gearing. The
gate-house has a scour-out pipe (also operated by a head-stock) and
duplicate copper screens fitted to iron frames. From this house the
water is conveyed to the upper portion of the conduit, which is a
45.7-cm. (18-in.) cast-iron pipe.</p>

<p>Of the total area of land, 885 hectares (2,187 acres), owned by the
company, 392 hectares (970 acres) have been fenced in, to prevent any
contamination of the springs. This fence is formed of five lines of
barbed wire protected with stout hog netting at the bottom, in order to
prevent more particularly the entrance of goats, many thousands of which
pasture in the adjoining mountains.</p>

<p>On the high ground immediately below the intake, a 3-roomed stone house
has been constructed for the inspector in charge of the intake works,
who also keeps in daily touch with the general office and records the
condition of the stream, particulars of rainfall, etc.</p>

<p><i>Aqueduct.</i>&mdash;The total length
of the aqueduct, from the intake dam to
the South Reservoir, is 18,700 m., made up as shown in Table 4.</p>

<p>The gradient of the concrete pipes is 0.43% from Estanzuela to Mederos,
and 0.53% from Mederos to the South Reservoir. The calculated
discharging capacity of the conduit when running full is 364
<!--507.png--><span class="pagenum">497</span>liters
(13 cu. ft.) per sec. for the upper, and 465 liters (16.4 cu. ft.) per sec.
for the lower section. For these pipes, the coefficient, <i>n</i>, in
Kutter's formula, was taken at 0.013. At present the line has been
limited by overflows to discharge three-quarters full.</p>

<p>The increase in the size of the pipes from Mederos is for the purpose of
receiving the waters of the Mederos River and other springs in the San
Pablo and Aqua Verde catchment areas, as shown on <a href="#p02">Plate
II</a>.</p>

<p>The invert of the concrete conduit where it leaves the Estanzuela River
is 684.25 m. above datum, and at the valve-house of the South Reservoir
it is 589.00 m.</p>

<p>The concrete pipes were manufactured and laid under contract with Mr.
Arthur S. Bent, of Los Angeles, Cal., the Company providing all
materials, labor, etc. The contractor was paid 10 cents per lin. ft. of
pipe manufactured and 10 cents per lin. ft. laid. He was also
responsible for the satisfactory completion of the work.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 shows the details of the joint recommended by Mr. Schuyler and
adopted for these pipes. The 63.5-cm. (25-in.) pipes were 61 cm. long
and 76 mm. (3 in.) thick. The 55.9-cm. (22-in.) pipes were of the same
length, but 70 mm. (2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.) thick. For the purpose of strengthening
these pipes while hauling them over very rough roads they were
reinforced with four rings of No. 6 galvanized-iron wire.</p>

<p><i>Manufacture of Pipes.</i>&mdash;The pipes were manufactured under the
Supervision of Mr. H. Stanley Bent, at a pipe yard established below
<!--508.png--><span class="pagenum">498</span>the
crushing plant, from which the crushed rock and sand were delivered
by gravity in bogies run on narrow-gauge rails. The area of the pipe
yard was approximately 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> hectares, and it was laid out with parallel
lines of 76-mm. (3-in.) galvanized-iron piping with hose couplings for
sprinkling purposes. After trials with aggregates of various sizes, the
concrete for the pipes was proportioned by volume as follows:</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate III, Fig. 2.&mdash;Steel Forms for Moulding Concrete Tubes,

</div>

<p>The above quantity manufactured two 63.5-cm. pipes; a 55.9-cm. pipe
required 0.1415 cu. m. (5 cu. ft.) of the material, in the same
proportions. Fig. 9 shows the forms for these pipes, and Fig. 2, Plate
III, illustrates the process of moulding. The forms
consist of cast-iron bottom rings, to the proper section of the joint,
and inner and outer steel forms of 3-mm. plate, provided with inner and
outer locking arrangements. The concrete was poured through a cast-iron
hopper which fitted to the top of the outer form.</p>

<p>The concrete, which was mixed very dry, in a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-cu. yd. batch, "Smith"
mixer, was thoroughly tamped with a 22-lb. tamper, and worked until it
was of a stiff jelly-like consistency, the wire rings being added as the
concrete was placed. The best results were obtained with the minimum
quantity of water. The upper joint was moulded with a heavy cast-iron
ring. The jacket and core forms were loosened immediately, and placed
over other rings, a sufficient number of bottom rings being used for a
day's work. For the pipes required for curves, special forms were used
to give the necessary bevel to the joint. After 24 hours the finished
pipes were lifted from the bottom ring with a special lifter, and ranged
in position for coating internally with a Portland cement grout to which
a little freshly slaked lime was added. The pipes were all numbered, and
were kept moist for 10 days by constant sprinkling. They were not hauled
to the work until 28 days after they were moulded, although this rule
was sometimes broken, to the detriment of the pipes. More than 32,000
pipes were
<!--510.png--><span class="pagenum">500</span>manufactured,
but some were used for purposes other than the
Estanzuela Aqueduct.</p>

<p><i>Cost of Pipes.</i>&mdash;The contractor brought with him experienced concrete
pipe makers from California, and these were afterward assisted by
Mexican labor. In a day two tampers could manufacture from 45 to 50
pipes of the larger (63.5-cm,), and from 55 to 60 of the smaller
(55.9-cm.) size.</p>

<p>The cost varied from 2.75 to 3.25 pesos per pipe for the smaller, and
from 3.50 to 4.00 pesos for the larger size.</p>

<p>The approximate cost of manufacturing is as follows: Taking, as a fair
example, one week's work during March, 1908, the wages paid to the 74
men comprising the total pay-roll (though part of this labor was
intermittent) amounted to 981 pesos. This includes a general foreman at
10 pesos per day, four American tampers at 7.50 pesos, and Mexican labor
varying from 4 to 1 peso, and all labor necessary to handle and finish
the pipes, including coating the interiors. During this week there were
made 1,126 of the 63.5-cm. and 1,095 of the 55.9-cm. size. The pay-roll
includes 520 pesos for the larger pipes (46 cents each) and 461 pesos
for the smaller pipe (42 cents each). Table 5 shows the quantities and
cost of the materials used in the manufacture of these pipes.</p>

<p>From Table 5 it is seen that the cost of the 63.5-cm. pipes was 3.37
pesos for material plus 0.46 peso for labor = 3.83 pesos per pipe, or
6.26 pesos per lin. m. (1.91 pesos per lin. ft.).</p>

<!--513.png--><p><span class="pagenum">501</span></p>

<p>The cost of the 55.9-cm. pipes amounted to 2.66 pesos for material plus
0.42 peso for labor = 3.08 pesos per pipe, or 5.05 pesos per lin. m.
(1.54 pesos per lin. ft.).</p>

<p>The cost of cement included hauling from the bodega to the yard, a
distance of about 5 km. At a later date, after the Company had commenced
using the "Hidalgo" cement, some additional 55.9-cm. pipes were
manufactured, so as to have them on hand as a reserve in case of
emergency. In this work only Mexican labor was used, as the previous
gang had been dispersed, but the tampers had previous experience. Taking
the cost of 418 pipes made during one period of 9 days, the detailed
cost was as given in Table 6.</p>

<p><i>Excavation for Pipe Line and Siphons.</i>&mdash;The excavation for the pipe
line and for bridge works, etc., was let by contract to Messrs. Scott
and Lee, of Monterrey, under three classifications:</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em">(1) "All material which in the judgment of the Engineer can be
economically loosened with picks and handled with shovels."</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em">(2) "Indurated earth or gravel, shale or rock which can be loosened
without blasting, and 'sillar', locally so-called, whether pure or
mixed with other substances, and whether it requires blasting or
not."</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em">(3) "All rock not included in the above which requires drilling or
blasting."</p>

<p>Locally, this classification is well understood, particularly No. 2, as
it covers the sillar soils which are common in the neighborhood of
<!--514.png--><span class="pagenum">502</span>Monterrey.
The contract prices were: No. 1, 50 cents; No. 2, 1.50
pesos; and No. 3, 2.50 pesos per cu. m. These prices were over and above
the clearing and grubbing of the line, which was paid for at the rate of
100 pesos per hectare.</p>

<p>The route of the pipe line being along broken country, at some points
difficult of access, service roadways, about 3 m. wide, for hauling
material were constructed, and, for about 7 km., a roadway was made
along the line of the trench.</p>

<p>The prices for the roadway, under the above classification, were: For
No. 1, 35 cents; No. 2, 1.50 pesos; and No. 3, 2.50 pesos per cu. m.</p>

<p>The trenches were excavated 5 cm. below the required finishing depth, to
allow for grading the pipes in selected material, and were taken out to
an average width of 40 cm. greater than the outside diameter of the
pipe, to allow for their proper jointing, and also to give sufficient
room to roll the pipes in the trenches.</p>

<p>The final quantities of excavation were:</p>

<p>The route of the pipe line was laid out so as to obtain an average fill
of not more than 1 m. over the tops of the pipes, but in some cases the
cuts, for short lengths, were 3 m. deep. The excavation for this work
began in June, 1907.</p>

<p><i>Hauling Pipes.</i>&mdash;The pipes were hauled to the site of the work with
ox-carts and mule teams. The cost of hauling varied from 25 cents per
pipe at the lower end, to 1 peso per pipe at the upper and,
comparatively speaking, inaccessible portion of the line. The weight of
each 55.9-cm. pipe was about 182 kg.; that of each 63.5-cm. pipe was
about 216 kg.</p>

<p>The breakages in all the pipes cast at the pipe yard amounted to about
1%, due chiefly to unloading them carelessly near the pipe line.</p>
<!--515.png--><p><span class="pagenum">503</span></p>
<p><i>Pipe Laying.</i>&mdash;The pipe-laying gang was composed of 7 Mexicans under
the direction of an American foreman, who was in charge of several
gangs. One gang could lay daily from 60 to 73 m. (from 100 to 120
pipes). The following was the ordinary pay-roll for one gang:</p>

<p>This brings the average cost of laying the pipes to 32.8 cents per lin.
m.</p>

<p>The pipes were jointed with 1:2 cement mortar, the outer joint being
rounded over both pipes for a width of 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cm. (5 in.) and a height
of about 19 mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.). In making these joints the pipe layers wore
rubber gloves. The joints were kept moist, and the trench was
back-filled with fine, screened material to a depth of 10 cm. above the
top of the pipe. Inside, the joints were carefully caulked with cement
and rendered smooth, the plasterers working continuously along with the
pipe layers, doing from 20 to 35 m. at a time. Water had to be conveyed
to the trenches by barrels on burros, and during the dry season it was
sometimes carried 5 or 6 km.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Bridges.</i>&mdash;The line as laid out passed over many gulches and dry
arroyos, and these were crossed with reinforced concrete bridges of
varying spans and heights, two being shown on Plate IV.</p>

<p>These bridges were formed of continuous horizontal girders, 1.10 m. deep
and 1 m. wide, with a cantilever overhang at the abutments, varying in
length from 1 to 2 m., so as to avoid settlement between the pipes and
the bridges. The bottom reinforcement consisted of from 2 to 6 twisted
bars of mild steel, varying in different spans from 12.7 to 19 mm. (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.) in diameter. The turned up bars were 28<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mm.
(1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.)
in diameter; they were placed on either side, carried over the upper
part of the beams, and continued along the end for the
<!--516.png--><span class="pagenum">504</span>overhanging part
of the girder. These bars, when not obtainable of the full length, were
spliced with a lap of 1.2 m. with No. 6 galvanized-steel wire. The
vertical stirrups were 4.7 by 25.4 mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> by 1 in.), of mild steel;
they were equally spaced 30.5 cm. (12 in.) apart, and carried all around
the girders, lapping at the center about 15 cm. (6 in.), all the steel
being carefully wired together before placing the concrete.</p>

<p>The general type of the piers and abutments is shown by Fig. 1, Plate
IV, and varies in height with practically every bridge,
the foundations in every case resting on hard rock. The concrete for the
girders was a 1:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mixture, the crushed stone used having all
passed a mesh of 19 mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.). The piers were of 1:3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
concrete, and heavy "displacers" were embedded within them.</p>

<p>The concrete was placed after the pipes had been laid through the form
by the pipe contractor, the joints being kept clear of the bottom to the
required distance by small moulded concrete blocks. The tops of the
girders were moulded to a slightly segmental form. The bridges were all
kept watered for about 15 days, and the forms were not struck for 28
days after placing. At Station 13.4 the pipes were carried over a
picturesque arroyo on an elliptical arched bridge (Fig. 2, Plate
IV) of 11 m. clear span.</p>

<p>The abutments of all bridges were protected by rubble walls in cement
mortar carried up 60 cm. above the tops of the girders.</p>

<p>The contract price for the concrete work of these bridges, the Company
furnishing the steel and cement, was 14 pesos per cu. m., and for
placing reinforcing steel 35 pesos per metric ton (2,204 lb.).</p>

<p>There are 49 single-span bridges, the larger spans being 9.10 m.; 8
two-span, and 11 three-span bridges, their total length, including the
overhang, amounting to 870.50 m., or 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>% of the whole length of
aqueduct.</p>

<p><i>Concrete Aprons.</i>&mdash;At 76 points there were small depressions which did
not necessitate the construction of bridges, and at these places the
pipes were encased in blocks of concrete carried up the hillside in the
form of an apron having small abutment walls from 1 to 2 m. apart. This
also served to protect the pipes from scouring action during rainstorms.
At the upper end of the line, near the intake, the pipe had to be
protected by concrete continuously for a distance of about 300 m., in
order to prevent damage from falling rocks.</p>
<!--517.png--><p><span class="pagenum">505</span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate V, Fig. 1.&mdash;Ventilating Column and Entrance Manhole,
Estanzuela Aqueduct.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Ventilators and Manholes.</i>&mdash;Along the route of the concrete pipe there
are 27 ventilators, one of which, together with an entrance manhole, is
shown by Fig. 1, Plate V. They consisted of simple
concrete columns, 3.35 m. high, above the ground line, the interior of
the shafts being formed of fire-clay pipes, 15 cm. (6 in.) in diameter.
At each ventilator the pipe was cut and a block of concrete, the width
of the trench, filled in as a foundation. Entrance manholes were also
placed at 49 points, at 27 of which they immediately adjoined the
ventilating columns.</p>

<p><i>Estanzuela Tunnel.</i>&mdash;At 1,560 m. from the intake at Estanzuela, the
conduit is laid through a tunnel 281 m. long. The tunnel was driven
through hard calcareous strata from the open cuttings at each end. The
inner dimensions were trimmed to approximately 2 m. high and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m.
wide. At the ends of the tunnel the rock was moderately easy to take
out, but the inner section was very hard and difficult to blast.
Ordinary hand drilling was adopted, and the actual cost of driving
varied from 28 pesos per lin. m. at the ends to 50 pesos in the center.</p>

<p>The pipes were laid through the tunnel in the ordinary way, and
back-filled from the center, so as to give a cover of about 45 cm. above
to protect them from falling pieces of shale.</p>

Crossing at North End of Tunnel, Estanzuela Aqueduct.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Siphons.</i>&mdash;It has already been mentioned that there are 6 cast-iron
pipe siphons. The head on these varies between 10 and 38 m. All are
provided with special inlets and outlets, forming combined overflow and
ventilating chambers, and have wooden hand-sluices to divert the water
when necessary. The bottoms of all siphons are provided with 20-cm.
cast-iron scour-out pipes, fitted with valves, and carried down to a
lower point to obtain a free outlet. The valve-boxes are protected by
being placed in heavy concrete chambers carried up above the level of
ordinary floods.</p>

<p>The siphons are formed of cast-iron socket pipes, 3.65 m. (12 ft.) long,
caulked in the ordinary way with lead joints. The thickness of the
45.7-cm. (18-in.) pipes is 19 mm.; that of the 50.8-cm. pipes is 21 mm.
On the steep hillsides the pipes are anchored securely to the rock in
concrete blocks reinforced with heavy iron chains. In some cases these
siphons were difficult of access, but ox-teams hauled the pipes in a
very efficient and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p><i>Overflow Chambers.</i>&mdash;The ordinary overflows, of which there are 14, are
similar in design to the siphon inlets.</p>
<!--518.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span></p>
<p><i>Testing, etc.</i>&mdash;When the line was completed it was tested for
water-tightness, and the loss was found to be about 5%, part of which
was probably due to absorption. At a later date it was found that the
waters of the Estanzuela River, which contain 150 parts of calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) per million, deposited a very fine film of lime on
the interior of the pipes, completely filling any pores there might have
been. At the present time there is no measurable leakage, thus proving
that the character of the work is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The water was turned into the conduit on June 11th, 1908, and delivered
to the city on the following day through a by-pass, before the reservoir
was completed.</p>

<p>The pipe line is patrolled daily by an inspector with the authority of a
gendarme, so as to prevent the unlawful abstraction of water, a very
necessary precaution in so dry a country.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="South_Distributing_Reservoir" id="South_Distributing_Reservoir"></a>South Distributing Reservoir.</span></h2>

<p>The distributing reservoir for the Estanzuela supply is at Guadalupe, on
the foot-hills to the south of the Santa Catarina River, about 2 km.
from the center of the city. The reservoir is a covered one, of
reinforced concrete, and its capacity is 38,000,000 liters (10,000,000
U. S. gal.).</p>

South Reservoir Before Lining.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Excavation and Embankment.</i>&mdash;The heavy slope of the ground at the
selected site made the circular form the most desirable. On the low side
the ground was excavated about 2 m. below the original ground line,
while the excavation at the upper part of the slope was about 12 m.
deep. The excavated material consisted chiefly of sillar and limestone
conglomerate, which when broken up forms a calcareous clay of an
excellent character for the formation of embankments, when proper care
is taken. The dimensions fixed for the internal diameter of the finished
concrete work of the reservoir were: 81 m. (265.68 ft.) at the top, and
a depth of water of 9 m., with sides sloping 55 in 100.</p>

<a href="images/i507.jpg" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>Fig. 10 is a plan of the reservoir, with a cross-section of the
excavation and embankment. On the lower side the original ground line
was cut down in steps, and all loose earth, roots, etc., were carefully
removed. The floor of the reservoir was chiefly sillar conglomerate, a
hard material that required a considerable amount of blasting for its
removal. The embankments were formed in 10-cm. layers
<!--519.png--><span class="pagenum">507</span>of sillar and
conglomerate broken into small fragments and then rolled with 3-ton
sectional rollers drawn by teams of 4 and 6 mules, which assisted in
disintegrating the mass thoroughly, and produced by constant wetting a
homogeneous and compact clay. The excavation and embankment were left so
that 15 cm. of trimming could be done at a later date, immediately prior
to the lining of the reservoir. The excavated material amounted to about
34,000 cu. m., and, of this quantity, 31,500 cu. m. were used to form
the embankment; the
<!--520.png--><span class="pagenum">508</span>remainder
was taken to a spoil bank immediately
adjoining, the black earth stripping being separated and reserved for
covering the reservoir, etc. The contract prices for the excavated
material placed in the embankment were:</p>

<p>The prices (for the same classification) for material taken to the spoil
bank, were 0.40, 0.80, and 1.40 pesos, respectively. Of the material
taken out, 15% came under No. 1 classification, 80% under No. 2, and 5%

<p>The excavation was begun at the end of May, 1907, and completed in
January, 1908, by Scott and Lee, the contractors. The embankments were
then allowed to stand until the beginning of July, 1908, to permit the
whole to become thoroughly settled and consolidated prior to beginning
the lining. In July the work of trimming the embankments and excavating
for the foundations of the reservoir columns was commenced, under the
Company's own administration, which completed the entire work.</p>

<p><i>Concrete Lining and Roof.</i>&mdash;The general arrangement and details of the
side-walls, columns, and roof are shown on Plates VI, VII, VIII and <a href="#i09">IX</a>. The
principal feature consists in dividing the reservoir into radial
sections and supporting the roof on 135 primary and 670 secondary beams,
from 135 columns, spaced as follows:</p>

<p>The inner bottom diameter of the reservoir is 70.32 m. (230.64 ft.); the
upper inside diameter is 81 m. (265.68 ft.); the water depth at the
overflow level is 9 m. (29<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ft).</p>
<!--521.png--><p><span class="pagenum">509</span></p>
<p>The roof was designed to carry a dead load (the earth cover) of 150 lb.
per sq. ft., and a live load of 100 lb. The maximum compressive fiber
stress in the concrete was assumed at 550 lb. per sq. in. for the beams,
and at 350 lb. for the columns, a low figure, because of their eccentric
loading. The tensile strength of the steel was taken at 14,500 and
16,000 lb. per sq. in. The twisted steel used for the column
reinforcement was made at the local steel plant, but for the beams,
etc., a twisted lug bar, of higher quality and greater permissible
tensile stress, was used. The total quantity of steel used was 178 tons.
It was calculated that the load on the column foundations would not
exceed 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tons per sq. ft. With
the exception of the side-wall and
floor, all the concrete was reinforced with steel, of the sizes and
spacing shown on <a href="#p06">Plate VI</a>.</p>

<p><i>General Construction and Erection Scheme.</i>&mdash;The question of ordinary
forms, requiring very heavy timber work, was a serious one, as suitable
lumber is very expensive in Mexico; and the necessity of finishing this
reservoir before the end of the first term allowed under the concession,
which expired on December 31st, 1908, led to the adoption of what the
writer believes is an original scheme for so large a structure. This
scheme was to cast the columns in short sections, mould the radial and
secondary beams as separate members, and then place them in position
with derricks. At the same time, in the case of the beams, it was
important not to sacrifice either the benefit of that part of the slab
which is ordinarily assumed to act as a part of the beam, or the
additional strength due to continuity; and, in case of the columns, the
strength due to the reinforcement extending from the foundation to the
beams.</p>

<p>The T-beam section was secured by notching the tops of the moulded
members, with notches 10 cm. deep, throughout the lengths of the beams,
as shown on <a href="#p06">Plate VI</a>. A computation of the maximum flange
increment shows that these notches are sufficient to transfer the flange
stresses to the stem, but, for additional security, flat steel bars were
bent to a Z-shape and embedded in the top of the beam, about 60 cm.
apart. Continuity in the beams was secured by carrying the steel to the
tops of the beams over all supports, and, after erection, concreting
them into the roof slab. The secondary beams, after casting, were
dropped into recesses left in the radial beams for the purpose.</p>

<!--522.png--><p><span class="pagenum">510</span></p>

<p><i>Concreting, Mixing, etc.</i>&mdash;The radial beams and column sections were
cast as nearly as possible under their ultimate positions; the secondary
beams were cast outside and immediately adjoining the reservoir.</p>

<p>The rock and sand was brought from the Company's crushing plant, in
3-cu. yd., side-dump cars, running on a 30-in. track by gravity a
distance of 1 km., the last 150 m. requiring hauling with 6 mules. The
cars returned all the way to the crusher by gravity. These cars dumped
the material into bins on the high ground above the reservoir; from
there it was hoppered into cars which carried to the mixer all the
material for one batch of concrete. Two No. 1 Smith mixers were used,
and from 25 to 30 batches per hour could be handled in each machine.</p>

<p>The concrete was transported from the mixers to place in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-cu. yd.,
18-in. gauge, swivel, steel dump-cars pushed by two men. All the
concrete used in the bottom of the reservoir, for the main beams,
columns, and floor, amounting to about 2,460 cu. m., was dumped through
a chute into smaller cars. The chute had so many baffle-plates and bolts
that it resembled a gravity mixer, but, although it was 12 m. long, it
effectively prevented the separation of the materials.</p>

<p><i>Concrete Placing and Moulding.</i>&mdash;The square foundations for the columns
were deposited <i>in situ</i>, a recess being left for the reception of the
pedestals, which were moulded in place afterward. The capitals and
pedestals were cast in one piece, and the columns in 1.21-m. (48-in.)
sections, eight 5-cm. holes being left in them by using wrought-iron
pipes, held in place by templates and removed when the castings were
about 3 hours old. The columns were erected by threading them on the
15.8-mm. (<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in.) reinforcing rods, which extended from the pedestals
up through the capitals. The rods were in two lengths, arranged to lap
alternately at one-fourth, the center, and three-fourths of the height
of the columns. In erection, a light timber frame was used in
conjunction with the derrick, and, as the columns were placed, the
reinforcing steel was grouted solid with 1:2 cement mortar.</p>

<p>All the erection was done with a combined stiff-leg or guy derrick,
having an 80-ft. boom and a 50-ft. mast, and fitted with a 30-h.p.
Lambert hoisting engine. The derrick was erected seven times at the
circumference, and its final position was on top of the center columns.
The moving of the derrick a distance of about 45 m. and its subsequent
<!--525.png--><span class="pagenum">511</span>erection
occupied usually about 48 hours. The erection work was carried
on continuously, day and night, the placing of the whole of the radial
and secondary beams and columns occupying 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months.</p>

<p><i>Forms.</i>&mdash;As the erection scheme was designed to reduce the cost of
forms, economical construction was of considerable importance. The wall
was formed in 40 panels, about 6 m. wide and 11.27 m. high. The chief
object in arranging them in this manner was to permit an expansion
joint, 30 cm. wide, at each panel; this joint was not filled until after
the completion of the roof, when the temperature inside the reservoir
was uniform and not subjected to such great fluctuations as if exposed
alternately to the hot sun and comparatively cool nights. The range of
temperature during the construction period sometimes amounted to 80°
Fahr. in 24 hours.</p>

<p>The expansion joints were left to the last, when a uniform temperature
of about 70° inside permitted the filling of the joints, thus avoiding
all trouble from expansion cracks.</p>

<p>The forms are shown in detail on <a href="#p07">Plate VII</a>. They
consisted of shutters stiffened with four trapezoidal trusses. The
bottom posts of the trusses were fixed in holes formed in the foundation
block; they were propped back from the embankment at the top, and
secured to anchorages by iron rods.</p>

<p>Six sets of these forms were used to construct the whole wall. The
concrete was placed in position through stove-pipe chutes, 20 cm. in
diameter, in continuous layers, the workmen treading and spading it well
as it was deposited. The forms were allowed to remain 4 or 5 days, and
were then struck and removed to another section. The pedestals and
capital forms were of lumber, and five of each were used to cast the
total number required. In the column sections the outer steel forms used
in the manufacture of the Estanzuela pipes were adapted for this
purpose. The radial beam forms, shown on <a href="#p07">Plate VII</a>, were
arranged with internal wedge-shaped blocks to mould accurately the
recess for the secondary beams. The bottom forms were left attached to
the beams for 28 days, but the sides and ends were removed after 24
hours. Eight forms were sufficient for the whole 135 beams.</p>

<p>For the secondary beams, 29 forms were used for the 670 beams, the
bottom lumber also being left until they were mature for handling.</p>

<p>By referring to the cross-section of the secondary beam, it will
<!--526.png--><span class="pagenum">512</span>be
noticed that it is jug-shaped, shelves being left on either side for the
support of the roof forms, which were placed after the secondary beams
had been properly grouted to the radial ones. The lagging was laid
diagonally, so that the short diameter was slightly greater than the
distance between the beams. This greatly facilitated the removal of the
lagging, as it was merely necessary to strike the wedge-shaped fillets
beneath, and turn them clockwise, after tearing out the end lagging.</p>

</div>

<p>The writer believes that the adoption of forms of this type, rather than
the ordinary kind, led to a saving of lumber of about 400,000 ft. b. m.
During the erection and placing of the concrete, all the joining
surfaces were carefully picked and cleaned, particular care being taken
at the junction of the secondary with the radial beams, and the upper
surfaces of all beams before laying the roof slab.</p>

<p>After the greater part of the roof was completed, the floor was laid in
those sections where it was protected from the sun's rays. The concrete
was placed in two 15-cm. thicknesses, and the work was carried on night
and day, without any joints. The laying of the floor occupied 8 days, or
an average of nearly 100 cu. m. daily.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Proportions of Concrete.</i>&mdash;All the concrete work was brought to a
smooth face by careful spading, no plastering being used throughout the
reservoir, except in the superstructures. The work was kept well watered
in every case for about 15 days. The whole of the concrete work in
connection with the reservoir was completed in 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months. The
concrete for the columns and foundations was a 1:3:5 mixture, the
aggregate consisting of equal parts of 19-mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.) and 38-mm.
(1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.) crushed stone. The remainder of the concrete, except that
for the roof, was a 1:2:4 mixture, the aggregate also consisting of
equal parts of 19-and 38-mm. stone. With the exception of a short length
of the side-walls, the sand used was that manufactured by the Company.
When the crushing plant was unable to produce all the sand required, the
Hornos sand (see Table 3) was used in the side-walls in equal
proportions with the crusher sand.</p>

<p><i>Reservoir Outlet and Entrance Tower.</i>&mdash;The outlet, 61 cm. (24 in.) in
diameter, leads from a well in the center of the reservoir and passes
under the floor and embankment to an outside valve-pit, 89 m. from the
center. This pipe was laid in a trench in a solid cutting before the
construction of the embankment, and was encased in 1:4:8 concrete.
<!--529.png--><span class="pagenum">513</span>Where
it passes under the embankment a 1:2:4 concrete cut-off wall, 3.6
m. wide, 2.5 m. high, and 1 m. thick, was placed across it at right
angles. The cast-iron pipe is curved upward in the central well, and has
a bellmouth on which rests a movable circular copper screen.</p>

<p>Above the outlet well, and on the roof of the reservoir, there is a
central tower, giving access to the interior by a steel stairway. This
tower also serves as a main ventilating shaft, and in it are arranged
the guide-screens and gearing for raising them for cleaning purposes. In
addition to the ventilation provided in the tower, 20 circular openings,
30 cm. in diameter, are carried through the roof of the reservoir at the
circumference and into the parapet walls.</p>

<p><i>Inlet Gate-House, etc.</i>&mdash;The inlet gate-house is above the reservoir
and about 54<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m. from its center. The conduit enters at 589.00 m.
above datum, and the gate-house contains the valves for controlling the
inlet pipe to the reservoir, the by-pass, overflow, scour-out pipe, and
the copper screens. The inlet, which is 45.7 cm. (18 in.) in diameter,
is of cast-iron flanged pipes, carried on iron hangers on the side-wall
of the reservoir, and, at a point 90 cm. above the floor level, it is
turned at right angles to the side-wall and carried on concrete piers to
the center of the first row of columns. The end of the pipe is closed by
a blank flange, and the water is deflected at right angles through two
30-cm. (12-in.) branches, for the purpose of setting up a slight
circular motion as it enters the reservoir.</p>

<p>The valve-pit is clear of the embankment, and in it are brought together
the main supply and by-pass pipes on which are placed two 61-cm.
(24-in.) sluice-valves; and between them there is a 20-cm. (8-in.)
scour-out pipe, for emptying the reservoir into an adjoining arroyo. The
arrangement of the valves gives complete control over the contents of
the reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Venturi Meter-House.</i>&mdash;Fig. 11 shows the arrangement of the Venturi
meter and its automatic register in a house over the main supply pipe.
This house is designed to form a feature of the entrance gateway of the
reservoir grounds, which cover an area of 12 hectares.</p>

<p><i>General.</i>&mdash;The roof of the reservoir has been laid out as a garden, and
the embankments are turfed. The intention is to develop the Company's
land as a public park, as it commands fine views of the city and the
surrounding mountains. An inspector's house has been built, and a
private telephone line provides for communication with the Estanzuela
intake and also with the general offices in the city.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="San_Geronimo_Gravity_Supply" id="San_Geronimo_Gravity_Supply"></a>San Geronimo Gravity Supply.</span></h2>

<p><i>Provisional Supply.</i>&mdash;It has already been stated that the Company began
operations at San Geronimo in March, 1906, by sinking a well on the
north bank of the Santa Catarina River at San Geronimo. At this point, a
little later, a small steam pumping plant, sufficient to handle about
8,000 liters per min., was installed. The lowest depth to which this
well was ultimately sunk in water-bearing strata, was 7 m., the normal
level of the water during 1906 and 1907 never falling lower than 569 m.
above datum. Tests made from time to time during 1907-08, showed that
this well was capable of supplying nearly 10,000,000 liters (264,000
gal.) of water daily.</p>

<p>The excellent supply yielded by this well made it desirable to adopt it
immediately as a provisional measure, pending the completion of the
larger works forming the western source of supply. To utilize the well
to its fullest extent, a reinforced concrete reservoir, of 3,000,000
liters capacity, was constructed on the south bank of the river, the top
water level being 585 m. above datum, that is, at the same elevation as
the proposed reservoir for the Estanzuela supply. The reservoir is 53.80
m. long, 21 m. wide, and has a water depth of 3.25 m. at the overflow
level. It is excavated on a steep hill slope, and has an earth
embankment on the lower side. The lining is of concrete, 20 cm. thick,
and the roof is of reinforced concrete composed of flat arches springing
from beams carried on 46 by 35-cm. reinforced columns. There are 68 of
these columns, and they are 3 m. apart longitudinally and 5 m. apart
transversely. The roof was not constructed until October and November,
1907, and prior to that time the necessity of covering the reservoir was
amply demonstrated by the growth, during hot weather, of considerable
quantities of green algæ, which had to be skimmed from the surface of
the reservoir every few days.</p>

<p>The delivery pipe from the pumping plant was originally of riveted steel
and was asphalted. It was 30 cm. in diameter, 2 mm. in thickness, with
slip joints, and where it crossed the river it was encased in concrete.
This pipe was afterward replaced by a cast-iron pipe of the same
diameter. The supply pipe to the city was also of sheet steel, 30 cm. in
diameter. For a part of its length it was laid in the high ground of the
south bank of the river, which it crossed near the western limits of the
city, and was then connected to a 30-cm, cast-iron pipe in the
<!--534.png--><span class="pagenum">516</span>distribution
system. The total length of the pipe from the reservoir to
the city distribution system was 2,850 m.</p>

<p>This provisional pipe continued in service from October, 1906, until
August 27th, 1909, when the river portion was completely swept away,
together with the provisional pump-house at San Geronimo, during the
great flood in the Santa Catarina River. Fortunately, the permanent
supply works were completed at the time, so that the destruction of this
pipe line, which had already served its original purpose, had no effect
on the supply of water to the city.</p>

San Geronimo Gravity Supply.</span></span><br />
<a href="images/p11.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p><i>Infiltration Gallery.</i>&mdash;The chief feature of the San Geronimo gravity
supply is the infiltration gallery. By referring to the profile on Plate
XI it will be seen that at this place there is a
considerable area of what is undoubtedly water-bearing gravel. The main
conditions were revealed by the borings previously carried across the
valley, but the profile has been corrected to show the actual conditions
as established at a subsequent date by shafts. Practically, the
water-bearing strata are not limited merely to the sand and coarse
gravels, as the clay formation lying above and below them is full of
small gravel deposits containing considerable volumes of water. The main
direction of the underflow is toward the east, and the hydraulic
gradient, which was established from wells sunk farther west, was found
to be approximately 1%, or practically the same as the average surface
of the bed of the river above the line of the infiltration gallery.</p>

<p>The general scheme for tapping this underflow was to drive a main
gallery at the 560-m. level on a grade of 0.05%, which was sufficiently
high to take the supply by gravity to the western reservoir, having a
top water level at 558.75 m. above datum. This elevation is sufficient
to give an excellent pressure over about 60% of the city, and a fair
pressure to reach the upper stories of the highest houses, if required,
over the whole supply district. From this gallery it was proposed to
sink shafts at frequent intervals, for a total distance of 300 m.,
carrying them below the gallery level, to tap any water-bearing gravels
there might be in the clay formation underlying the gravels and sands.
From the main gallery it was proposed to construct branch galleries up
stream on a flat gradient, so as to obtain the advantage of an increased
head due to the steep hydraulic gradient of the underflow water.</p>

To March 1910 At San Geronimo.</span></span><br />
<a href="images/i517.jpg" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>In investigations of this kind, it is of first importance to have a
continuous record of the level of the water plane, and Fig. 12 has been
<!--537.png--><span class="pagenum">517</span>plotted
to show its variation at San Geronimo from the beginning of
1905 to March, 1910. From January, 1909, to March 31st, 1910, these
levels are averages of daily readings taken in 9 shafts sunk along the
proposed line of the infiltration gallery. In 1902 the water plane was
standing at 570.18 m. above datum, but from that date until 1905 the
writer has been unable to find any records. This diagram should be
examined together with the rainfall diagram, Fig. 3, and it will be
noticed that the fall in the water plane drops with the general scarcity
of the rainfall during 1907-08, and until July, 1909. The year previous
to July, 1909, is regarded, by many competent local observers to have
been the longest period of extreme drought in 30 years in Nuevo León,
and the evidence which the writer has been able to gather regarding
stream flow in the neighborhood of Monterrey supports this view. The
total rainfall at Monterrey for the year prior to July 1st, 1909,
amounted to 9.98 in., or 4.16 in. less than the lowest record for any
<!--538.png--><span class="pagenum">518</span>calender
year since 1894, or, in other words, about 45% of the average
annual rainfall.</p>

<p>The lowest point to which the water plane dropped was during June and
July, 1909, when the levels stood slightly above 565.00 m., or 5 m.
above the level of the floor of the infiltration gallery. During this
period pumping tests were made in the various wells, and from these it
was quite clear that the infiltration gallery, if carried far enough to
meet them all, would yield a supply of from 25,000,000 to 40,000,000
liters daily. During the great rainfall of August, 1909, the water
levels rose very rapidly; the heavy precipitation between August 9th and
10th caused the level to rise to 568.00 m. in about 4 days, and 6 days
after the great flood of August 27th, the water level, which had
continued rising gradually, reached 571.40 m., and then fell gradually
until at the end of March, 1910, it was practically the same as it had
been from 1902 to 1905.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the readings were taken in the shafts on the
high ground to the west of the present river bed, and were independent
of any flow there might be in the river. During times of ordinary floods
in the river, it was very noticeable that, notwithstanding the fact that
the river water might be turbid to an extreme degree, the well even in
immediate proximity to the river bed did not show the least sign of
discoloration.</p>

<p><i>Design of Works.</i>&mdash;Plate XII shows the general design of
the gravity scheme, which consists of a main tunnel 550 m. long and a
concrete aqueduct, 1.06 m. (42 in.) in internal diameter and 2,311 m. in
length, discharging into a low-service distributing reservoir at the
extreme western limits of the city. The tunnel and aqueduct were laid on
a gradient of 0.05%, and the latter was designed to discharge 55,000,000
liters per day (22.8 cu. ft. per sec.) if flowing to its full capacity.</p>

<p><i>Gravitation Tunnel.</i>&mdash;This tunnel, shown on Plate XII
and Fig. 13, was completed prior to driving the
infiltration gallery into the water-bearing gravel, so that the water
encountered in the gallery could be easily drained off by gravity, thus
avoiding a heavy outlay for pumping. The tunnel passes through various
strata, the principal ones being calcareous shale, conglomerate, and
gravels. The tunneling operations were carried on from 5 shafts, No. 1
being 23 m. deep, and the others varying from 20 to 10 m. The shafts in
loose ground were
<!--540.png--><span class="pagenum">520</span>timbered
in the usual way, having clear inside
dimensions of 2 m. Shaft No. 1, which was entirely in shale, was taken
out approximately to 3.35 m. in diameter, so as to permit it to be lined
with concrete having a finished internal diameter of 2.43 m.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 13 shows the details of the tunnel, which was lined with concrete,
the bottom and sides being approximately 23 cm. (9 in.) thick. The
interior dimension is 0.91 m. at the invert level and 1.016 m. at a
height of 1.22 m., the corners between the side-walls and the floor
being slightly curved. The arch is formed of two rings of brickwork in
cement mortar, this thickness being increased in some lengths to three
rings. Where the rock was in good condition, and not likely to
disintegrate easily, the arch, for a distance of 90 m., was left
unlined. Of the total distance of 550 m., careful timbering was required
for 300 m. In lining the timbered portion of the tunnel with concrete,
all the timber was removed, except in loose ground, where the laggings
were left in position.</p>

<p>While the tunnel was being driven, a start was made to drive the north
end of the infiltration gallery, which was in rock for a distance of 44
m. Water appeared at about 35 m., and then the work was temporarily
suspended until the gravitation tunnel was completed and a length of the
aqueduct had been constructed far enough down stream on the north bank
of the river to permit of draining direct to the river. This point was
reached at 1,170 m. from Shaft No. 1, and there a temporary overflow
chamber was constructed.</p>

<p>When the tunnel was completed, the two intermediate shafts were filled
up, the remaining three being retained permanently. Shafts Nos. 2 and 3
were lined with concrete, 76 cm. (30 in.) in internal diameter, and 23
cm. thick. They were domed at the top to form circular openings to
receive cast-iron covers. Progress on this tunnel was slow, taking from
December, 1907, to November, 1908, to complete, owing chiefly to
difficulties with an incompetent contractor. The contract was
subsequently transferred to Mr. John Phillips, of Mexico City (who was
also the contractor for the aqueduct), who completed it satisfactorily.</p>

<p><i>Continuation of the Infiltration Gallery.</i>&mdash;When the aqueduct (to be
referred to again) was completed as far as 1,170 m. from Shaft No. 1,
the driving of the infiltration gallery, which was 2 m. high and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
m. wide, was continued until gravel was encountered in the roof, at 44
m.
<!--541.png--><span class="pagenum">521</span>from
the shaft. At this point the rock dipped at an angle of 45°,
and the gravels contained quantities of large boulders mixed with fine
sand; immediately after encountering the gravel, a flow of about 90
liters per sec. was met, evidently coming through from a pot-hole in the
shale. This quantity diminished in about 10 days to about one-fourth,
but gradually increased again as the driving proceeded. The operations
of driving the tunnel from 44 m. forward were begun in the dry season,
in February, 1909, and the gravel was encountered for a distance of 24
m., or up to 68 m. from the shaft. The center of this gravel bed was
about 30 m. south of the old river channel, which had been continuously
dry at the surface for several years. Up to 68 m. the work was very
difficult, owing to the upper part being of loose gravel and the lower
in very contorted shale. The timbering of the tunnel in the full gravel
section consisted of heavy square settings, 1 m. apart. At 68 m. the
clay and gravel formation was met, and the rate of progress then was
about 4 or 5 m. a week. A short branch gallery was also driven about 7
m. up stream near Shaft No. 2. The total distance the infiltration
gallery was carried from Shaft No. 1, was 100 m., when the floods of
August, 1909, caused its suspension.</p>

<p>During the progress of the gallery, attempts were made to sink a 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
by 2-m. shaft at a point along the line of the infiltration gallery,
about 130 m. from Shaft No. 1, but water in such abundance was
encountered that it was practically impossible to sink it in the
ordinary way more than about 6 m. deep, the quantity of water to be
dealt with amounting to about 20,000,000 liters daily. Seven shafts were
then sunk in the high ground to the north of the river, five of these
being on the line of the gallery and two 30 m. westward. They were sunk
during the dry season prior to July, 1909. These were ordinary timbered
shafts, 2 m. square between the walings, and were carried to the depths
shown on <a href="#p11">Plate XI</a>. In Shafts Nos. 5, 6, and 7 the water
was flowing with considerable velocity, while Shaft No. 9 seemed to have
penetrated a different water plane and one which was probably
independent of that showing in any of the other shafts, in which the
water was practically at a uniform level. The evidence obtained showed
that if the gallery could be carried to Shafts Nos. 6 or 7 a great
abundance of water would be intercepted. Owing to the difficulties of
sinking ordinary shafts in the wide river channel, circular shafts were
put down. These were 1.37 m. in internal diameter and 23 cm.
<!--542.png--><span class="pagenum">522</span>thick, and
were of concrete reinforced with No. 10 vertical rods, 19 mm. in
diameter, tied together with No. 6 wire. These shafts were provided with
steel cutting edges.</p>

<p>Shaft No. 2 was sunk to a depth of 1 m. below the infiltration gallery
level, No. 3 within 2 m., and No. 4 within 4 m., before August, 1909.
The shafts were sunk by digging them out and loading them at the top,
the top of the shafts being kept generally 3 m. out of the ground. Shaft
No. 3 encountered great volumes of water, and, in order to enable
sinking operations to proceed, a pumping shaft, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> m. square, was
sunk a little west of it to draw off the water. Notwithstanding the fact
that the prolonged period of drought had lowered the general water plane
in all the shafts to 565.00 m. above datum, the difficulties of handling
the water even at that level were considerable. At the beginning of
August the work was progressing very satisfactorily, but the
extraordinary rainfall of that month caused the work to be shut down
temporarily.</p>

<p><i>Effect of the Floods in the Santa Catarina River.</i>&mdash;The area of the
water-shed of the Santa Catarina River above Monterrey is about 1,410
sq. km. (544 sq. miles), and its area at San Geronimo, owing to its
configuration, is practically the same. Its general character has
already been referred to. On the night of August 10th and early on the
morning of August 11th, a big flood came down the river, flowing at its
maximum about 1,130 cu. m. (40,000 cu. ft.) per sec., due to the heavy
rainfall <a href="#i485a">(Fig. 4)</a>. This flood carried away all the temporary staging
around the shafts, seriously wrecking the temporary pumping station, as
well as destroying the 30-cm. cast-iron pipe, notwithstanding the fact
that it had been encased in a block of concrete 3 m. wide and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m.
thick right across the river; but no damage was done to the infiltration
gallery or to the shafts in the river channel. The effect of the flood
on this pipe is shown by Fig. 2, Plate XXXI.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="i485b" id="i485b"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate XXXI, Fig. 2.&mdash;Profile Sketch, Looking Up Stream On Line Of
24-inch Main Supply Pipe.</span></span><br />
<a href="images/i485b.jpg" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>Following this flood, which had caused the loss of 14 lives in the city,
3 miles below San Geronimo, there was practically no rain for 13 days.
Then, on August 25th the second heavy precipitation began and continued
until August 29th, the details being shown on <a href="#i485a">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>This precipitation, therefore, fell on a water-shed which was completely
saturated, as it had already absorbed a large proportion of the 13.38
in. of rain which fell during August 10th and 11th; and at every point
along the river, prior to August 25th, springs were issuing forth,
<!--543.png--><span class="pagenum">523</span>and
there had been very little evaporation during the intervening dry spell.</p>

<p>The writer has calculated that at Monterrey this flood reached the
enormous quantity of 6,650 cu. m. (235,000 cu. ft.) per sec., a rate
equal to 432 cu. ft. per sec. per sq. mile of
water-shed.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The effect
of this flood was to demolish completely about 1,200 "sillar" houses
(without taking into consideration the numerous wooden houses) at
Monterrey, and to cause a fearful loss of life, variously estimated
between 3,000 and 5,000 persons; the lower figure the writer believes is
approximately correct. At San Geronimo the original pumping station was
carried away entirely, leaving practically no trace whatever.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The
writer, in a brief article contributed to <i>Engineering
News</i> soon after the flood (September 23d, 1909), gave this figure as
271,500, or approximately equal to a run-off of 500 cu. ft. per sec. per
sq. mile; but, from a later and more complete study of the conditions
for many miles above Monterrey, he believes the above quantity to be
approximately correct.</div>

<p>Shaft No. 2 was apparently destroyed, while No. 3 was turned at an angle
of about 50° down stream and filled up completely with sand. The
infiltration gallery, near Shaft No. 2, was completely blocked with fine
sand and gravel, and access could only be obtained as far as 54 m. The
profile,<a href="#p11"> Plate XI</a>, shows the change which had taken place
in the river bed. The original course of the stream was changed to the
north bank, 50 m. distant, the effect of the scouring action of the
flood being to lower the general level at this point about 3.65 m.,
while the southern portion of the channel was slightly raised. At
present (April, 1910), the end of the driven portion of the infiltration
gallery is about 35 m. from the center of the stream, which is still
carrying about 2,270 liters (80 cu. ft.) per sec.</p>

<p>Immediately after the flood the flow in the gallery was 450 liters (16
cu. ft.) per sec., and this quantity has remained constant since that
time. The probable effect of the flood was to disturb the whole
subsurface above the infiltration gallery and put it in motion,
completely cleaning the gravels of their surrounding clay, which would
account for the large infiltration of water in so limited a distance.
The water has always been limpid and pure, but its hardness remains the
same as it was prior to the flood.</p>

<p>With the copious supply of water from this source, due of course to
abnormal conditions and not likely to be permanent, the operations of
tunneling have been suspended temporarily; but it is proposed to
<!--544.png--><span class="pagenum">524</span>continue
the driving of the gallery, from a new shaft west of No. 3.
The water encountered will be drained off by pumping until the main
water-bearing gravels, in the neighborhood of Shaft No. 5, are reached.
It is also proposed to reconstruct the 30-cm. high-level pipe line, from
San Geronimo along the high road on the north bank of the river, so that
by pumping water can be delivered to the city system from Shafts Nos. 5,
6, and 7, in the event of a shortness of supply from the Estanzuela
River.</p>

<p><i>Shaft No. 1.</i>&mdash;Shaft No. 1 is designed to connect the infiltration
gallery with the gravitation tunnel. This shaft has an inner diameter of
2.43 m. (8 ft.) and is fitted with a special gate-valve. In the bottom
of the door of this valve there is a smaller valve, 30 cm. in diameter,
so that, when the infiltration gallery is closed for cleaning out the
sump, the smaller door, which is operated through the same spindle by a
bevel-geared head-stock at the top of the shaft, can be opened first.
Space is also left for screens if these should be found necessary.
Access to this shaft is gained by a reinforced concrete stairway in nine
stages. The superstructure is to be supported on reinforced concrete
column foundations carried to the firm rock, owing to the loose
condition of the strata at the top of the shaft.</p>

<p><i>Aqueduct.</i>&mdash;The construction of the concrete conduit was begun in
April, 1908. <a href="#i519">Fig. 13</a> shows the general types. Type <i>A</i> was adopted in
gravel and conglomerate formation, and Type <i>B</i> where the excavation was
in "sillar," the soft nature of this rock permitting it to be excavated
exactly to the required external diameter of the concrete lining.</p>

<p>The concrete which was without steel reinforcement was a
1:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
mixture, the sand being from the crusher and the aggregate from the
river bed, screened to pass a 25-mm. mesh. Where the conduit crossed the
river obliquely, immediately below the gravitation tunnel, it was
strengthened with mass boulder concrete of Type <i>C</i>. During the great
flood this heavy section withstood its effects without damage of any
kind, but beyond this point, where the conduit had been laid in compact
cemented gravels, the scouring action of the flood on the north bank
lowered the level of the gravels from 2 to 3 m.; the only damage,
however, was the scouring away of the gravels at the south side of the
conduit. To prevent such an occurrence in the future, the conduit at
that point was strengthened with additional concrete for a distance of
<!--547.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>195 m.,
as shown on <a href="#i519">Fig. 13</a>. The extra concrete, amounting to 733 cu.
m., was a 1:3:5 mixture, in which was embedded 20% of heavy boulders.
The top of this special length now forms a weir for the present river
flow. Where the conduit enters the bluff on the north side of the river,
at 1,200 m., there is an overflow chamber which has a sluice-gate 76 cm.
wide, arranged so that the conduit can overflow at the present time when
running 76 cm. deep. To deflect the flow in the conduit, a wrought-iron
plate, provided with a balance weight, is dropped into a groove on the
lower side. The outlet is a 61 cm. concrete tube, having its invert
above ordinary flood level, and arranged to be closed by a gate.</p>

<p>At 1,963 m. the conduit is carried over an arroyo on a segmental arch of
8 m. clear span, as shown on <a href="#i519">Fig. 13</a>. There are 5 ventilating columns
and 5 manholes on the aqueduct.</p>

<p>The aqueduct terminates in the Obispado distributing reservoir
valve-house, at a level of 558.50 m. The work in connection with this
aqueduct was completed by December, 1908.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Distributing_Reservoir_at_Obispado" id="Distributing_Reservoir_at_Obispado"></a>Distributing Reservoir at Obispado.</span></h2>

<p>The main distributing reservoir for the San Geronimo gravity supply is
immediately below the historic Obispado (Bishop's Palace), at the
western limits of the city. The general arrangement and lay-out is shown
on Plate XIII.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="p13" id="p13"></a>

<a href="images/p13.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p><i>Valve-House.</i>&mdash;The invert of the conduit from San Geronimo, where it
enters the valve-house, is 558.50 m. above datum. The valve-house, which
is built in the center of the reservoir, is shown on <a href="#i20">Fig. 2, Plate
XVIII</a>. One of its special features is the provision of
the main overflow at this point instead of within the reservoir proper.
The inlet, main supply tunnel, independent by-pass overflow, scour-out
pipes, gate-valves, and screens, are all controlled within the
valve-house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><a name="i20" id="i20"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate XVIII, Fig. 2.&mdash;View of Roof of Obispado Reservoir, Looking
North.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Reservoir.</i>&mdash;The reservoir is rectangular, 126 by 81 m. (413.28 by
265.68 ft.) at the top, and has a water depth of 4 m. (13.1 ft.). In the
design it was necessary to limit it to the lowest economical depth, so
as to increase the static pressure over the low-pressure district as
much as possible.</p>

<p><i>Excavation and Embankment.</i>&mdash;The excavation, except for a depth of
about 1 m. which was in black soil, was chiefly in a disintegrated
<!--548.png--><span class="pagenum">526</span>"sillar"
stratum of a heavy clayey nature, the greater part of which
could be handled conveniently with plows and scrapers; the actual
foundation on the eastern half required blasting for the final depths.</p>

<p>The total excavation amounted to 56,479 cu. m., of which 7,255 cu. m.
were placed in the embankment, the remainder being deposited in the
immediate neighborhood of the reservoir. The final trimming of the
banks, which were left 30 cm. full, was not undertaken until the lining
was begun. The work was done under contract with Mr. J. S. Nickerson, of
Monterrey. The excavation had only one classification, and the contract
prices were 0.50 peso per cu. m. for material carried to spoil banks,
and 1.00 peso for material placed in the embankment. The excavation was
begun in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1908. The work was then
left standing until the end of 1908 to allow the banks to consolidate
thoroughly prior to lining, which was begun on January 4th, 1909.</p>

<p><i>Concrete Lining and Roof.</i>&mdash;<a href="#p13">Plate XIII</a> shows the general
plan and sections, the main feature being the simple division of the
reservoir into 24 rows of columns longitudinally and 15 rows
transversely, making a total of 360 columns, less the four left out at
the central tower. All the columns are 5 m. apart both ways. The roof
was designed for a live load of 100 lb. and a dead load of 150 lb., the
same as at the South Reservoir. With the exception of the floor, all the
concrete work was reinforced with twisted steel lug bars. The foundation
load on the columns for the eastern half of the reservoir is 0.9 ton per
sq. ft.; that on the columns for the western half, where the foundation
is of very hard sillar and conglomerate, is 1.95 tons per sq. ft.</p>

<p><i>Under-drainage of the Floor.</i>&mdash;To provide for proper drainage in case
of seepage, the floor was underdrained with rubble drains, 30 cm. wide
and 23 cm. deep, filled with large round gravel carted from the bed of
the Santa Catarina River. The total length of these underdrains is 1,160
m. In order to facilitate the detection of any seepage, they were
conducted to a permanent inspection pit outside of the reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Main Distributing Conduit.</i>&mdash;The main distributing conduit is laid
along the inside of the reservoir, at the inlet end, and carried on
elliptical arches of 2 m. span to a height of 71 cm. above the finished
floor level. This conduit is 76 cm. high and 45.7 cm. wide, and it
branches in two directions from the inlet tunnel to each side of the
<!--549.png--><span class="pagenum">527</span>reservoir,
its total length being 69 m. In order to prevent any
stagnation and to give a continuous circulation, the water is delivered
at eight points, in the length of the distributing pipe, through square
openings with semicircular tops, the areas of the openings increasing
toward the ends. These inlets are placed so that the current will not
strike the roof columns.</p>

<p><i>Outlet Tunnel and Valve-House.</i>&mdash;The outlet tunnel is at the north end
of the reservoir, and was excavated in hard sillar rock. The tunnel is
lined with concrete 30 cm. thick, the finished internal dimensions being
1.52 by 0.91 m. The length of the tunnel is 22.5 m. to the point where
it enters the outlet-house. This house is divided by a wall 45 cm.
thick, which supports a 76-cm. (30-in.) penstock-valve. The supply pipe
to the city leaves this chamber in the west wall, and is also fitted
with a 76-cm. penstock-valve. The supply pipe has a copper screen of the
same design and dimensions as those in the inlet-house. A 30-cm.
(12-in.) scour-out pipe in this chamber provides for draining the
contents of the reservoir to a neighboring irrigation ditch, when
necessary.</p>

<p>The superstructure of the valve-house is of concrete, and at the floor
level there are bevel-geared head-stocks to raise the valves, etc.</p>

<p><i>By-Pass and Supply Pipes.</i>&mdash;The by-pass and supply pipes are carried
below the reservoir embankment to join the main 76-cm. (30-in.)
cast-iron distributing pipe to the city. For this short distance they
were constructed of concrete, 76 cm. in internal diameter, 10 cm. (4
in.) thick, reinforced with 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-mm. square steel longitudinal rods, 30
cm. from center to center in the circumference, and hooped with
6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-mm. square steel rods spaced 30 cm. apart. The concrete forming
these pipes was a 1:1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mixture.</p>

<p><i>Parapet Walls.</i>&mdash;The parapet walls have 12 piers at each side and 8 at
each end. In these piers there are ventilating openings branching at the
top to each side of the parapet, with outlets provided with cast-iron
screens. This arrangement gives 4 sq. m. of ventilating space (exclusive
of that provided in the central tower), equally distributed at 40 points
around the walls of the reservoir.</p>

<p><i>General Construction Scheme.</i>&mdash;The concrete mixing plant, which
consisted of two No. 1 Smith mixers, was arranged in connection with the
bins and hoppers for the rock and sand on the high ground to the west,
and from there the material was conveyed on a framed timber
<!--550.png--><span class="pagenum">528</span>gangway
carried right across the center of the reservoir, as shown by Fig. 1,
Plate XVII. From this central platform the concrete for
the columns was filled from stages placed on the top of traveling
towers, 5 m. high, which were run between two rows of columns on
standard-gauge rails laid on the floor of the reservoir. By this
arrangement 24 columns could be filled from each length of track. A main
narrow track was also laid right around the reservoir, with the
necessary turn-outs.</p>

</div>

<p>The forms for the columns, primary and secondary beams, are shown on
Plate XIV. The side forms for the primary beams were
struck in 24 hours, so as to economize lumber; but the bottom lumber was
left in position for 28 days. To avoid much unnecessary timber, the
secondary beam forms were supported at the ends on reinforced concrete
corbels cast on the primary beams.</p>

<p>For placing the side-walls, a special traveling form was used, the
details of which are shown clearly on Plate XIV. At the
end of each form an expansion joint of 25 cm. was left to be filled
after the roof was placed in position. The concrete was delivered to the
wall through stove-pipe chutes, and carefully spaded by workmen in the
limited space between the forms and the embankment. The wall form was
removed after 36 hours, by loosening the jacks and pulling forward the
hooked tie-rods. This form is also shown on Fig. 2, Plate
XVI.</p>

Reservoir.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The concreting of the roof slab was carried on continuously, and, when
partly completed, the floor was laid in the shade. The bottom layer of
the floor, 13 cm. thick, was laid in continuous panels between the
columns, and brought to a fairly smooth surface. On this surface, after
keeping it wet for 10 days and then allowing it to dry thoroughly, a
layer of asphaltum, supplied by the American Asphaltum and Rubber
Company, of Chicago, was placed. The work was done by ordinary Mexican
laborers after they had received a few days' instruction from one of the
Asphaltum Company's superintendents. The surface of the lower layer was
kept perfectly clean, and then received one coat of "Pioneer" paint. The
asphaltum, heated in a boiler inside the reservoir to a temperature of
approximately 425° Fahr., was then poured over the floor from buckets,
in a layer approximately 4 mm. thick. Where the floor joined the column
pedestals, and at each new panel section, a double thickness was used.
The labor cost of water-proofing, including superintendence, etc.,
amounted to
<!--553.png--><span class="pagenum">529</span>3.3
cents (Mexican) per sq. m. for painting with "Pioneer"
paint, and 5.4 cents for the asphaltum coating, or a total labor cost of
8.7 cents per sq. m. for the complete water-proofing. This cost is based
on a rate of 8.00 pesos per day for a foreman, and 1.00 peso for each
laborer. It required 50 U. S. gal. of the paint to cover 265.2 sq. m.,
and an average of about 6 lb. of asphaltum for 1 sq. m.</p>

<p>The upper concrete layer of the floor, 10 cm. thick, was placed so as to
break joint with the lower, and was brought to a smooth surface with
wooden floats sheathed with steel and reaching across the panels. In
this way a perfectly smooth surface was obtained without any plastering.</p>

<p>The concrete for the beams, columns, side-walls, and floor, was a
1:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:4 mixture, crushed sand and stone being used throughout. In the
roof slab the mixture was 1:2:3.</p>

<p>The whole of the concrete work of the reservoir was completed in 6
months, by the Company's own administration, and the reservoir was first
put into service a few days after the great flood of August 27th, when
the Estanzuela supply main, crossing the Santa Catarina River, was
partly destroyed. Since that time frequent examinations of the
inspection pit, which is connected by a pipe to the rubble drains under
the floor, have never revealed the slightest leakage.</p>

<p><i>Lay-Out of the Reservoir Roof and Grounds.</i>&mdash;The Company owns about
11<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hectares of land, which includes that occupied by the reservoir
and its surroundings, and as this property is in an attractive
situation, commanding fine views of the Sierra Madre Mountains, the
whole of the works have been given a pleasing architectural character,
and the grounds laid out to form a public park for the citizens of
Monterrey.</p>

</div>

<p>The general plan of the scheme is shown by Fig. 14 and
<a href="#i20">Fig. 2, Plate XVIII</a>. The roof, which has an area of 1
hectare, has been laid out with walks and grass plots, and the
surrounding embankments have been converted into driveways. Above the
reservoir a small plazuela of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hectare has been laid out with a space
above it for a band-stand. The whole of the ground has been encircled
with carriage drives, on which it is the intention to plant shade trees.
The lay-out of this land also embraced the scheme for protecting the
reservoir by draining the surface-water away to the irrigation ditches.</p>

<p>The two reservoirs are practically of the same capacity, the only
difference being the level of the overflows in their relationship to the
roof, which gives the Obispado Reservoir a slightly greater capacity.
Some comparative figures may be of interest, owing to the differences in

<p>The total cost of these reservoirs, including valve-houses, by-passes,
and the length of supply pipe where the by-pass joins, and including all
engineering expenses, etc., but exclusive of the cost of lands,
planting, fencing, and special work in connection with the formation of
parks, was as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -3em; padding-left: 3em">South Reservoir: 394,000 pesos, or 10,368 pesos per million
liters.</p>

<p>These rates may be regarded as reasonable when taking into consideration
the special difficulties of construction in Mexico, and the high cost of
all imported material, on which heavy duties are levied.</p>

<p>The distribution system was begun in September, 1906, but the general
lay-out of the mains was modified in July, 1907, in view of the division
of the system into two services, for high and low pressure. Plate
XIX shows in skeleton form the lines of the cast-iron
mains. These are laid at the present time along routes containing houses
<!--557.png--><span class="pagenum">533</span>
(excluding wooden shacks) which
can be served immediately. The
distribution system is arranged to serve as follows:</p>

<p>This represents, at the present time, a division of the city of 32<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>%
for the Estanzuela, and 67<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>% for the San Geronimo supply. Of the area
of the supply district north of Santa Catarina River, 57% will be
supplied from San Geronimo and 43% from Estanzuela. The real development
of the city, however, is northward in the area of the low-pressure
supply.</p>

<p>The static pressure over the city in the two sections varies as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>The main supply pipe from the South Reservoir is 61 cm. (24 in.) in
internal diameter, and this size allows ample provision for future
extensions. The supply pipe from the Obispado Reservoir is 76 cm. (30
in.) in internal diameter. On this main, in Calle de Cinco de Mayo, at a
distance of 320 m. from the reservoir, has been placed a 76-cm. (30-in.)
Venturi meter, the recording apparatus being in the house on the side of
the road. Both these supply pipes are carried well into the city, and
from them the distribution mains are laid; these are 45.7 and 30 cm. (18
and 12 in.) in internal diameter, with intermediate sections of 15 and
10 cm. (6 in. and 4 in.). Along Calle de Cinco de Mayo, where the
division between the two services takes place, two lines are laid, a
30-cm. for high pressure and a 38-cm. (15-in.) for the low pressure. A
duplicate pipe, 30 cm. (12 in.) in diameter, is also laid in Calle de
Dr. Coss. On Calle de Alvarez the low-pressure pipe is 61 cm. (24 in.),
and the high-pressure, 45.7 cm. (18 in.) in diameter. Provision is also
made for extending the range of the two services to other districts.
Practically every block is provided with gate-valves to cut off the
supply in any direction. On the 76-cm. main, 61-cm. (24-in.) valves are
used, and are connected by tapers to the pipe. On the 61-cm. mains,
45.7-cm. (18-in.) valves are used. The actual frictional loss by
reducing the valve
<!--558.png--><span class="pagenum">534</span>being
small, this method permitted the use of valves
of a more convenient size. On all the larger valves there are 15-cm.
by-passes fitted with independent gate-valves.</p>

<p>Scour-out pipes, 10 cm. (4 in.) and 15 cm. (6 in.) in diameter, are
placed in various parts of the system, draining to the sewers.
Air-valves, both double and single, are also placed at high points in
different parts of the system.</p>

<p><i>Reducing Valves.</i>&mdash;At four points in the system the mains are arranged
so that the supply can be interchangeable. Fig. 15 shows the arrangement
of the mains at the junction of Cinco de Mayo and Alvarez Streets, and
is typical of the arrangement at the other points.</p>

<p>Each reducing valve is placed on a 30-cm. (12-in.) branch main between
the two services. These valves adjust themselves automatically to the
pressure required, after they have been properly regulated to the
different pressures on either side. To allow repairs to be easily made,
there are ordinary gate-valves at each end enclosed in the same pit. If
necessary, as in case of fire, any part of the system can be changed
into high pressure temporarily by closing the valves against the San
Geronimo supply.</p>

<p>The pipes were all cast according to the British Standard Specification,
in 3.65-m. (12-ft.) lengths, and were supplied by Messrs. D. Y. Stewart
and Company, and Messrs. Dick, Kerr and Company, of Kilmarnock and
London. The valves were all of standard design, faced with gun-metal,
and were supplied by Messrs. Glenfield and Kennedy, Limited, of
Kilmarnock, Scotland.</p>

<p>In the distribution system it is proposed to provide 200 fire-hydrants,
by arrangement with the municipality, but only a few of these have been
placed. The general type is a double hydrant for two 63.5-mm.
(2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.) streams. These are to be placed at the corner of every block
in the business portion of the city; single-way hydrants will be used in
the residential districts.</p>

<p><i>Laying Cast-iron Pipes.</i>&mdash;Table 10 has been prepared to show what can
be accomplished with Mexican labor in laying pipes. In this kind of work
the labor was particularly efficient; after the gangs were once drilled
into shape, the work proceeded systematically, and at very good speed.
All the pipes, after being laid, were tested to 150 lb. per sq. in. in
the presence of the Technical Inspector.</p>

<p>Table 11 gives the details of the excavation, the material, and the
average cost, of laying about 106.6 km. of pipes.</p>

<p><i>House Connections.</i>&mdash;The ordinary house connections, which are of
19-mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.) galvanized-steel pipe, are connected to the mains by
lead goosenecks and brass corporation cocks. The Company's obligation
under the concession extended to the edge of the sidewalk, and at this
point curb-boxes, chiefly of the Hays pattern, were placed; but,
subsequently, owing to the metering of every house service in the city,
the control of the Company extended to the meter, which, as a rule, is
placed immediately inside of the house. Owing to the rapid deterioration
of the house service pipes in some districts of the northern part of the
city, where the soil is formed of decaying organic matter, it has been
decided to use lead pipe entirely from the main to the meter.</p>

<p><i>Damage Due to Floods.</i>&mdash;During the night of August 27th, the main
61-cm. pipe, under the river bed of Santa Catarina, at the point where
the main entered the city, was destroyed for a distance of 130 m., due
to the scouring away of a whole block of city property. The Venturi
meter register chart at the South Reservoir showed that the break
occurred a few minutes before midnight. The location of this pipe is
shown by <a href="#i485b">Fig. 5</a>; its broken end was in proximity to an old bridge pier.
Fortunately, at the time of the flood, the Obispado Reservoir works were
completed, and the whole city was supplied with water from San Geronimo
within 48 hours. As only about 1,500 services had then been connected,
this delay was not serious; in fact, in the lower part of the city, the
water in the mains was sufficient until the San Geronimo supply could be
connected. To make a temporary connection
<!--561.png--><span class="pagenum">537</span>to conduct the high-pressure
water to the city, a 15-cm. steel pipe was placed above ground, on the
line of the main, for a distance of 100 m. This pipe was supported by a
cable, 30 mm. in diameter, and by timber trestles. By limiting the
supply district, this pipe was of sufficient capacity to serve until the
large main could be safely restored.</p>

<p>The flood destroyed about 1,200 houses in the neighborhood of the river.
In a number of blocks the smaller mains were scoured away, but
considerable salvage was done afterward, and, as it is the intention of
the authorities not to permit rebuilding along the flood-path of the
river, these mains do not require reconstruction.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Main_Sewerage_System"
id="Main_Sewerage_System"></a>Main Sewerage System.</span></h2>

<p>The Company's obligations, as far as drainage is concerned, were limited
to the removal and disposal of sewage, no provision being required for
storm-water, which is allowed to find its way to the natural
watercourses. Apart from that fact, however, the best system for a city
like Monterrey, where rainfall for many months at a time is very scarce,
is the strictly "separate system." In the design advantage was taken of
the natural topography of the drainage district, which is almost an
ideal one for a gravitation system of sewers, the general fall in all
directions being northeast; it was also in this direction that the best
available land could be obtained for disposal purposes.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate XX.&mdash;Diagram Of The Main Sewers Of Monterrey.</span></span><br />
<a href="images/p20.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>Plate XX shows in skeleton form the general lay-out of
the sewers. Two drainage districts are arranged, divided by Calle de
Washington, which may be regarded as practically the center of the city,
and each of these districts has an independent main collector connecting
to the outfall sewer at the northeast extremity of the city.</p>

<p>The system has been designed so that extensions may be made and may
cover any part within the city limits; the main collectors are large
enough for the whole area when fully built up.</p>

<p>The sewers are designed on a very liberal basis, namely, on the
assumption that when flowing half full the quantity to be dealt with
will be 380 liters per capita per day, with a maximum rate of flow of
200 per cent. It was assumed that each house would be occupied by 7
persons and have a frontage of 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m. The minimum velocities in the
sewers, when running full, vary between 0.91 and 1.5 m. per sec., with
the exception of a few blocks.</p>
<!--566.png--><p><span class="pagenum">540</span></p>
<p>The minimum size adopted was 24.3 cm. (8 in.) in internal diameter. The
sewers of diameters between 24.3 and 50 cm., are 0.91 m. (36 in.) long,
and are of salt-glazed vitrified clay, imported from San Antonio, Tex.</p>

<p><i>Effect of the Flood on Sewers.</i>&mdash;The flood of August 27th and 28th,
1909, partly destroyed one of the main collectors, which was laid along
the banks of the river and encased in concrete. This has now been relaid
farther north, and out of the way of any future floods. The total length
of the new sewers replacing those damaged amounts to 1200 m., and they
vary in internal diameter from 20 to 55.9 cm. (8 to 22 in.).</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Main_Outfall_Sewer"
id="Main_Outfall_Sewer"></a>Main Outfall Sewer.</span></h2>

<p>The direction of the main outfall sewer was determined after a thorough
study of all the available land lying to the north and northeast of the
city, as it was the intention of the Company to utilize
<!--571.png--><span class="pagenum">543</span>for
irrigation purposes the sewage and any surplus waters that might be developed. The
best available site was found to be about 12 km. north of the city, a
little northwest of the village of San Nicolas de los Garzas, as shown
on <a href="#p02">Plate II</a>. The long length of outfall required was
justified by the cheap cost of the land and its excellent character for
sewage irrigation. The sewer was designed for a capacity of 90,000,000
liters a day (36.76 cu. ft. per sec.) in order to allow for conveying
surplus waters as well as sewage.</p>

<a href="images/p22.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>The outfall intercepts the two main branches of the city sewers at Calle
de Allende and Calle de Tapia, and its total length is approximately
<!--572.png--><span class="pagenum">544</span>11,900 m.
The chief type adopted is shown on Plate XXII.
It is formed with an invert of radial bricks laid in 1:2 cement mortar,
on a foundation of 1:3:5 concrete approximately 7 cm. thick. As the
ground was chiefly in hard sillar, only a little concrete was required
to mould the bottom to the correct shape. The arch was formed of special
radial bricks, 15 cm. (6 in.) deep, laid in cement mortar. These bricks
were adopted in preference to concrete, owing to the heavy cost of sand
and rock, due to the long haul, and for the purpose of obtaining rapid
work. <a href="#i21">Plate XXI</a> shows the sewer arch, and one of the
ventilating columns and manholes. The bricks were obtained from the
local brick plant, and form a very satisfactory material for sewers,
being well burnt, thoroughly hard, and absorbing not more than 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>% of
their weight of water. The contract prices for the labor on the
brickwork were 1.25 pesos per sq. m., and 1.38 pesos for the arch.</p>

<p>The general route of the sewer is very direct, long straight lines of
several kilometers being possible, and these were joined by curves of
approximately 30 m. radius. The gradient of the sewer invert is 0.2% (1
in 500) which is approximately the general fall of the ground northward
from Monterrey.</p>

<p>The total quantity of excavation was as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The contract prices for this excavation were: for No. 1, 32 cents; No.
2, 85 cents; and No. 3, 2.17 pesos per cu. m.</p>

<p>All the excavation was in perfectly dry ground. Where the sewer was
partly out of the ground it had a foundation of concrete, 1.75 m. wide,
from 15 to 23 cm. thick, below the bottom of the brickwork, and carried
up to the springing of the arch, and a well-tamped embankment, with
slopes of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 1, to protect the sewer to a height of 30 cm. (12
in.) above the arch. For 342 m. at the Monterrey end of the line, the
sewer was constructed in tunnel, from, the open end and from two
intermediate shafts. The tunnel throughout was in sillar, and the
contract price for excavation was 24.50 pesos per lin. m. This work was
done without timbering of any kind, except at the shaft lengths. <a href="#p22">Plate
XXII</a> shows
<!--573.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>the
lining of the tunnel, which was of
concrete with a brick invert. At four places the sewer passes under main
railway tracks, which at these points were carried on steel girders
supported on concrete abutments, the sewer being carried under the
tracks in the ordinary way.</p>

<p><i>Bridges.</i>&mdash;At three points the sewer was carried over arroyos on
reinforced concrete girders. No. 1, at Station 5,600, consisted of four
10-m. spans; No. 2, at Station 8,365, over the Estanscia Arroyo,
consisted of nine 10-m. spans; and No. 3, at Station 8,960, over the
Topo Chico Arroyo, consisted of three 10-m. spans. One of these bridges
is shown on Plate XXIII. They were designed as two
parallel continuous girders with connecting top and bottom slabs. The
concrete for the girders was a 1:2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>:3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mixture, the sand being
from the crusher and the rock gauged to pass a 19-mm. (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.) screen.
The inside was rendered with a coat of 1:1 cement mortar, 7 mm. thick,
for water-tightness.</p>

<p>The piers of the Estanscia Bridge (Plate XXIII) were
carried down through soft earth to a stiff clay from 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 6 m. below
the surface, and the foundations were spread so that the pressure would
not exceed 1 ton per sq. ft. The ends of the bridges were protected by
rubble wing-walls supporting the embankment over the sewer. A 1:3:5
concrete was used for the upper part of the piers, and the lower part
was of the same mixture with 30% of large boulders. There are 70
manholes (Fig. 19) along the line of the sewer, and they vary from 150
to 230 m. apart. The sewer is ventilated with 30 concrete towers (Fig.
18, and <a href="#i22">Fig. 2, Plate XXI</a>), 2.9 m. high,
having 20-cm. (8-in.) shafts.</p>

<p>The works for the outfall sewer were carried out satisfactorily under a
contract with Mr. John Phillips, of Mexico City, the Company supplying
the greater part of the materials. The work was begun on March 16th, and
finished on November 12th, 1908.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Sewage_Disposal_Works_and_Irrigation_Lands"
id="Sewage_Disposal_Works_and_Irrigation_Lands"></a>Sewage Disposal Works and Irrigation Lands.</span></h2>

<p>For the purpose of disposing of the sewage and using it profitably, the
Company purchased 909 hectares (2,246 acres) of land from the Community
of San Nicolas de los Garzas, the outfall sewer being carried to the
southwestern boundary of the land acquired. This area has a general fall
in all directions to the northeastern boundary, with a gradual fall of
about 25 m. across the diagonal of the land. The area purchased was
practically virgin land, only small portions having
<!--574.png--><span class="pagenum">546</span>been cultivated.
The greater part was covered with a growth of mezquite trees and small
shrubs. The quality of the land is excellent, if properly irrigated, and
capable of yielding abundant crops of every description. The limits of
this land are shown on <a href="#p02">Plate II</a>.</p>

<p><i>Sewage Purification Tanks.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of obtaining a
satisfactory effluent to discharge on the land without causing nuisance,
the Company built a system of detritus chambers and liquefying tanks at
the end of the outfall sewer. One difficulty to be faced, in designing
these works, was the fact that there were no data regarding the probable
quantity of dry-weather sewage, nor any particulars as to its general
<!--576.png--><span class="pagenum">548</span>character;
there was also the probability that the outfall sewer would
have to carry large quantities of surplus water. Therefore, the system
was designed so as to be capable of extension if necessary, and the
sizes of the various tanks were limited at present, because of the
septic processes which would be set up in the long length of outfall
sewer. The tanks were designed to deal with 10,000,000 liters of sewage
proper per day, and the channels, etc., were proportioned to take the
full flow of the sewer if necessary. Provision was also made for
discharging large volumes of surplus water directly on the land,
independent of the tanks. To do this a by-pass was taken from the sewer
a short distance before reaching the site of the tanks. By properly
timing the flow, arrangements could be made to discharge these waters in
the early hours of the morning, by allowing the scour-pipes in the
distribution system to be opened at night when the domestic sewage flow
was at its minimum. As the area of land available is very great, the
degree of purification in the tanks was relatively unimportant; the
object to be obtained consisted chiefly in distributing on the land an
effluent which would be innocuous and clear.</p>

<p>The general design of the works is shown on Plate XXIV,
and they consist essentially of a screen chamber, duplicate detritus
tanks, and three liquefying tanks. There is also a sludge-pit 629 m.
from the tanks.</p>

chamber are shown on Plate XXV. The invert, where the
sewer enters the screen chamber, is 489.45 m. above datum. This chamber
has duplicate screens which are fully detailed on Plate
XXX. For cleaning purposes the screens are raised by a
steel-framed head-gear, which is arranged so that they may be lowered to
a small traveling bogie, out of the way of the screen chamber.</p>

<p>From the screen chamber there are two main channels, 1.22 m. wide,
branching to the two concrete detritus chambers. Each channel has a
square penstock, so that the sewage can be diverted into either chamber
when necessary.</p>

<p>The detritus chambers are octagonal in plan, 4 m. in diameter, and each
is provided with an outlet weir 1.50 m. wide. At the weir level the
chambers have a depth of 1.75 m., with drainage channels below that
level. The coping is 1 m. above the outlet weir of the detritus tanks.
To drain off these chambers, each has a scour-out pipe, 30 cm. in
<!--577.png--><span class="pagenum">549</span>diameter,
controlled from valves with spindles carried above the coping
level. Each of these pipes is connected to a central chamber, and leads
to a 56-cm. (22-in.) sludge-pipe. The chambers as designed are of
smaller capacity than those usually provided, but, as all surface water
is strictly excluded from the sewerage system, the quantity of detritus
reaching the chambers may be small. The velocity through them when both
are in use will be approximately 0.082 m. (0.27 ft.) per sec.</p>

<p>From these chambers the sewage is carried to the three liquefying tanks
by a main channel, 11.5 m. long and 1.50 m. wide.</p>

</div>

<p>The tanks are of concrete and have reinforced concrete roofs. Each is 66
m. long and 6 m. wide; the minimum depth for the sewage is 1.50 m. at
the outlet end, and 2.25 m. at the inlet, increasing to a maximum depth
of 2.75 m. at the lowest depth at the scour-out channel. Their combined
capacity is 2,500,000 liters, which is equivalent to 6 hours' flow of
the quantity of sewage for which they were designed. The sewage passes
from the main channel, through penstock-valves which control the flow,
into one or the other of the tanks. From these valve openings it flows
over concrete weirs, 5 m. long, and is deflected to the bottom of the
tank by a reinforced concrete scum-plate, extending across each tank,
with a clearance of 15 cm. at each end. This scum-plate is 1.5 m. deep
and 10 cm. thick, and is placed 40 cm. from the end walls.</p>

<a href="images/p29.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<p>The details of the concrete division and outside walls are shown on
Plate XXIX. The floor was constructed in two layers, and
its surface is divided into 6 channels formed by small walls, 20 cm.
wide and 15 cm. deep, the object of these channels being to facilitate
the cleaning of the floor by scouring it out to a specially arranged
channel at the deepest point of the tank, near the inlet end. Each
scour-out channel has a 30-cm. (12-in.) gate-valve, controlled from the
roof of the tank, the three scour-pipes meeting in a concrete chamber
outside of the tanks, from which a 56-cm. (22-in.) concrete pipe
discharges the contents of the tanks to the sludge-pit during cleaning
operations. The velocity through the tanks, when they are used in
combination, is 0.0253 m. (0.083 ft.) per sec., the tanks being made as
long as economically possible, in order to obtain this low velocity and
thus permit the proper sedimentation of the suspended matters. The roof
of each tank is 1 m. above the weir level. Each tank has four
ventilating columns, 3.7 m. high and 30 cm. in diameter, vitrified clay
pipes, with an exterior
<!--578.png--><span class="pagenum">550</span>casing
of contrete, being used for the shafts. The roof is enclosed within
parapet walls, and is covered with a
layer of earth 25 cm. thick.</p>

<p>The outlet channel from the tanks leads to a measuring chamber, 3 m.
square, as shown on <a href="#p29">Plate XXIX</a>. This chamber is fitted
with penstocks, 1.83 m. wide, and measuring weirs. From this chamber the
sewage is delivered to two main irrigation ditches, which distribute the
sewage in two directions, one northward and the other to the western
extremity of the lands.</p>

<p><i>Construction of Tanks.</i>&mdash;The excavation for the tanks was in soft earth
for a depth of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m.; the lower depths were in a firm foundation of
sillar and calcareous clay. The total excavation in the tanks, channels,
etc., was 8,335 cu. m., and the actual cost was 45<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cents per cu. m.
To facilitate the construction, about six-tenths of the concrete beams
were cast as single monoliths and placed in position by sliding them

<p><i>Sludge-pit.</i>&mdash;The sludge-pit, used when cleaning out the tanks, is
carried 639 m. northward, far enough to get the available fall to drain
the bottom of the detritus chambers and liquefying tanks. The drainage
<!--581.png--><span class="pagenum">551</span>pipe
was formed of 56-cm. (22-in.) concrete tubes. The sludge-pit is
merely an excavation in the earth 20 m. square and 2 m. deep, the sides
having a slope of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 1. An overflow drains the pit to an
irrigation ditch, the solid matter being allowed to settle and the
liquid to drain off. From time to time it is proposed to dig out the
solids and plow them into the land.</p>

<p><i>General.</i>&mdash;To the east of the tanks a 3-roomed house has been built for
the inspector.</p>

<p>In order to provide a good supply of water for cleaning operations, a
well 22 m. deep has been sunk and is fitted with pumps operated by an
Eclipse windmill, 4 m. in diameter, on a tower 22 m. high, which
delivers the pump water to a circular wooden tank of 20,000 liters
capacity.</p>

<p>The work in connection with the purification tanks was carried out by
the Company's own staff; it was begun on September 10th, 1908, and
practically completed by the first week in January, 1909.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the tanks have to deal with the sewage from a
population of only 10,000 persons, as only from 15 to 20% of the
connections have been made. The sewage, therefore, has been diluted with
several times its volume of surplus water, and the necessary scum on the
top of the sewage in the tanks has not yet assumed the usual thick matty
condition observed in most systems. As there are no available means in
Monterrey of having proper determinations made of the degree of
purification which takes place in the passage of the sewage through the
liquefying tanks, a few simple tests have been made. These tests were
limited to the determination of the amount of oxygen absorbed in 4
hours, and show a purification of 50% in passing from the detritus
chambers to the outlet. The sewage, although very black and full of
suspended matter as it enters the tanks, leaves them in a very clarified
condition.</p>

<p>Of the total area of land acquired by the Company, 904 hectares (2,234
acres) have been leased to the Monterrey Railway, Light, and Power
Company, for 99 years, the Water-Works Company reserving 5 hectares (12
acres) absolutely for future extensions of the sewage works. By giving
12 months' notice, the Company also reserves the right to utilize any
part of 145 hectares (358 acres) near the tanks, should it be required
at any time in the future for sewage purification purposes.</p>

<p>All the work was practically under the direction of English-speaking
superintendents and general foremen. For the ordinary skilled and
low-skilled labor, Mexicans were employed exclusively, and, on the work,
which was quite new to them, they proved entirely efficient and
satisfactory; throughout the work, on which at some periods between
2,000 and 3,000 men were employed, chiefly under the Company's direct
administration, they were very tractable and willing to do their best,
and no trouble was experienced at any time. The Mexican "peon," and also
the ordinary skilled workman in the north of Mexico, is intelligent, and
is excellent for purely routine work, but he is not adaptable or
resourceful in cases of emergency. Under intelligent and careful
supervision, however, it is quite possible to get as good results as
could be obtained anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Tariffs.</i>&mdash;The tariffs charged for the water and drainage service
(Table 17) were approved by the State Government (which accepts the
responsibility for their collection), under a compulsory State law which
came into force on March 1st, 1910, for the southern portion of the
city, and on July 1st, for the northern half, the penalty for
non-compliance being a tax of 10% on the monthly rental value of the
property, as assessed by the State officials.</p>

<p>The basis of the tariffs (which were published on February 22d, 1909) is
a charge for water varying between 12 and 16 cents (Mexican) per 1,000
liters, with a minimum monthly rate for each different class of property
connected to the system. The rate for house drainage is fixed at 80% of
the minimum water rate levied on the consumer. The minimum rates have
been fixed so that the poorer classes of the community
<!--586.png--><span class="pagenum">554</span>will not be
overtaxed, while at the same time the rate is actually levied on the
quantity of water used, as indicated by the meter. All the services at

<p><i>Sanitary Regulations.</i>&mdash;The State Government, on March 1st, 1909,
published regulations for the proper installation of the water and

submitted by the writer, who prepared it, after a study of American
<!--588.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>and
British sanitary by-laws, to suit the special conditions of Monterrey.
These regulations were afterward modified by him in collaboration with
the Government Technical Inspector and Financial Interventor, and, in
their final form, though not as stringent as those adopted in many
northern cities, are probably more complete than those in any other
Mexican city. Under these regulations only registered plumbers can
undertake plumbing installations, and they have to execute a bond to the
satisfaction of the <i>Alcalde Primero</i> (City Mayor) for the sum of 2,000
pesos as a guaranty of responsibility. For defective workmanship or any
infraction of the plumbing regulations, they are liable to heavy fines,
and can be called on to make good all defects in workmanship, without
extra charge to the owner of the property. The provisions of the
regulations are carried out under the supervision of the Government
Technical Inspector, the Company's obligations extending only to the
sidewalk and to the meters placed within the houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="James_D_Schuyler" id="James_D_Schuyler"></a>James D. Schuyler, M. Am. Soc</span>. C. E. (by letter).&mdash;For completeness of
detail and wide range of subjects of general interest to engineers, this
paper is certainly one of the notable contributions to recent
engineering literature. It is a minute and painstaking record of the
successful accomplishment of construction work under unusual climatic
conditions and difficult circumstances, and reflects credit on the
author, not only in his capacity as an engineer, but as a faithful
recorder of facts. It was particularly fortunate that he was an
eyewitness of the disastrous and extraordinary flood which swept through
Monterrey, destroying many lives and much property, and has thus been
able to give an intelligent estimate of the maximum discharge of the
river during the height of the flood wave of August 27th-28th, 1909,
when the rate of run-off per unit of area of water-shed drained reached
an amount which has seldom been equalled or exceeded, as far as reliable
records extend. It is worthy of note that works deriving their water
supply from the source of such torrential floods should have survived
with so little actual damage, and with scarcely any interruption of
service. The repair of all damages to the system was estimated to have
cost not more than $20,000.</p>

<p>As Mr. Conway did not assume charge of construction until May, 1907, he
was spared the responsibility of deciding on the general plan of
securing an abundant supply of pure water from sources permitting of
delivery by gravity under adequate pressure for fire protection&mdash;a
responsibility which devolved on the writer, assisted by G. S. Binckley,
M. Am. Soc. C. E., Mr. Conway's predecessor, as Chief Engineer. Not only
the water-works, but the system of sewerage and sewage disposal by broad
irrigation were subsequently carried out on the plans submitted to the
State Government by the writer in 1906, and given provisional
acquiescence at that time.</p>

<p>There was no lack of water at hand for the supply of a city of that
size, as there are large perennial springs which flow out of the
travertine of the plain, and are used for irrigation in the valley below
the city. One of the largest of these, near the civic center, has a
normal flow of nearly 30 cu. ft. per sec.; another nearby, also within
the city limits, flows some 10 or 12 sec-ft., while both the Estanscia
and Robalar springs, but a few miles below (shown on <a href="#p02">Plate
II</a>), discharge more than 20 sec-ft., as nearly as memory
serves. Besides this supply, the water to be developed by sinking shafts
in certain parts of the plain, as demonstrated at the brewery and
elsewhere, was apparently a reliable source of large volume.</p>

<p>To utilize these sources, however, would have involved condemnation of
the water-rights in the case of the springs, depriving present owners of
the use of the water, and this Governor Reyes wished to
<!--590.png--><span class="pagenum">558</span>avoid. Besides,
it would have necessitated pumping the water for the city in perpetuity,
an expense which the Governor was equally anxious to save; hence a
gravity supply was made the prime requisite of the plans.</p>

<p>Until the concession was granted, and for a year or more afterward, it
was assumed that an adequate supply could only be obtained by the
storage of the flood-water of the Santa Catarina River in a large
reservoir; and the earlier plans of the concessionaires were based on
the construction of a high masonry storage dam at the upper end of the
"narrows," where the river turns from a western direction to a course
almost due east, between high vertical cliffs of limestone. The
concession distinctly provided for such a dam, and among the plans on
file in the State Capitol is one prepared by the late E. Sherman Gould,
M. Am. Soc. C. E., for a masonry weir across the gorge. Samuel M. Gray,
M. Am. Soc. C. E., also filed a plan and report proposing a capacious,
shallow, storage reservoir near the city, to be filled by a large
flood-water canal from the Santa Catarina Cañon.</p>

<p>Although the writer could not have anticipated the occurrence of floods
of the magnitude of the one of August, 1909, which would surely have
destroyed any reservoir built in the Cañon, he was unable to endorse the
storage plan of water development, chiefly because of the uncertainty of
the water-tightness of the reservoir in a cavernous limestone formation,
and also because of the probable impurity of water draining from such
extensive goat pastures. He, therefore, urged the development of the
underflow of the river, which was manifesting itself in the springs
referred to. Mr. Binckley secured two Keystone drilling machines and
proceeded to profile the bed-rock at Santa Catarina Cañon and at San
Geronimo, the two places on the stream where the river flows between
walls of rock <i>in situ</i>. At both sites the strata were standing nearly
vertical across the channel, and, by careful sampling and testing, it
was found that in both locations there were thick strata of limestone so
highly silicious as to be insoluble, and hence free from caverns. From
this determination it was concluded that all the water which appeared in
the valley below must pass through the sections where the borings were
made. The results of this drilling, however, proved conclusively that
the depth to bed-rock at either place was too great to permit of a
masonry dam being considered as practical, and demonstrated the
inadequacy of methods which had been used in the earlier investigations
when dams were regarded as feasible.</p>

<p>The results have also shown that the subterranean supply at the lower
cross-section of the river, at San Geronimo, is abundant, and can
probably be increased to an indefinite degree by continuing the
filtration gallery; while at Santa Catarina the same type of development
can be made for a high-source supply, although requiring a long and
expensive tunnel and conduit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="David_T_Pitkethly" id="David_T_Pitkethly"></a>David T. Pitkethly, Assoc. M. Am. Soc.</span> C. E. (by letter).&mdash;Having been
engaged on the design of sewerage systems for some years, the writer
finds this paper of peculiar interest, particularly the sewerage
portion. There are some points in the design, however, which do not
appear to be clear.</p>

<p>The system is described as "strictly separate," and yet the sewers are
designed to run half-full, providing a capacity of 200%, the 100% basis,
or 380 liters per capita, being 90%, or 180 liters, in excess of the
calculated water supply of 200 liters per capita.</p>

<p>It has been the writer's practice to design sanitary sewer systems on
the basis of the water consumption, and to assume the whole daily amount
to reach the sewer in 16 hours, thus providing capacity sufficient to
care for the maximum or wash-day flow without causing the sewers to run
above the calculated hydraulic gradient, which should be placed within
the pipe so as to provide air space for ventilation under all
circumstances.</p>

<p>The practice of calculating sanitary sewers to run half-full is a good
one when ground-water is expected in sufficient amount to fill the
remaining portion of the sewer, but when no ground-water, or roof-, or
surface-water is allowed to enter the system, or all precautions are
taken to exclude such, then the system may be designed so that the
expected maximum, or wash-day flow, will fill the sewer to the desired
hydraulic gradient.</p>

<p>The method of ventilating the sewers does not seem practicable. The
houses are principally of one story, and yet the stand-pipes on the
sewers have openings 25 ft. 9 in. above the sidewalk. Are the
ventilating or vent pipes of the house plumbing carried to a height to
balance this, or will these chimneys draw the air from the house drains
and fresh-air pipes, breaking the seal in the so-called disconnecting
traps, thus causing the circulation of air in the house piping to be
downward through the sewers instead of upward through the fresh-air
inlets and vents, as designed?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that crude sewage, as well as the liquefying
(septic) tank effluent, is to be applied to land for irrigation
purposes, but the application of crude sewage without any attempt at
removing the suspended matter, or the effluent from the septic tanks
where only a partial removal occurs, seems to be bad practice.</p>

<p>The author states that:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The degree of purification in the tanks was relatively unimportant; the
object to be obtained consisted chiefly in distributing on the land an
effluent which would be innocuous and clear."</p>

<p>How he expects to obtain such an effluent by passage through screens,
detritus tanks, and septic tanks only, is more than the writer can
understand.</p>

<p>The removal of suspended matter in a septic tank depends on the
<!--592.png--><span class="pagenum">560</span>strength
of the sewage, the time of retention, the time elapsing
between cleaning, the presence of trade wastes, etc., and seldom exceeds
38 per cent.</p>

<p>The subject of septic tanks and their effect on sewage is discussed in
the "Fifth Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal" (England,
1908), and the following extracts, relative to the application of crude
sewage to land and the effect of septic tanks on sewage, seem apropos:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"23. * * * There are also many cases in which crude sewage has been
passed over land, but the evidence shows that land treatment of
crude sewage is liable to give rise to nuisance by the accumulation
of solids on the surface of the land. Moreover, in some cases these
solids are apt to form an impervious layer, which interferes with
the aeration of the soil, and so impairs the efficiency of the
treatment."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"31. * * * At that time it was claimed that the septic tank
possessed the following, among other, advantages:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That it solved the sludge difficulty, inasmuch as practically all
the organic solid matter was digested in the tank.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That it destroyed any pathogenic organisms which there might be in
the sewage."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"32. As regards the first of these claims, it is now clearly
established that, in practice, all the organic solids are not
digested by septic tanks, and that the actual amount of digestion
varies to some extent with the character of the sewage, the size of
the tanks relative to the volume treated, and the frequency of
cleansing."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"At Huddersfield, Mr. Campbell estimated that about 38 per cent. of
the solids were converted into gas or digested; * * * while at
Birmingham, Messrs. Watson and O'Shaughnessy say that the figures
available indicated a digestion of not more than 10 per cent. of
the suspended matter entering the tanks."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"33. As regards the second claim, we find as a result of a very
large number of observations that the sewage issuing from the
septic tanks is, bacteriologically, almost as impure as the sewage
entering the tanks."</p>

<p>Messrs. Winslow and Phelps, in their interesting paper, "Investigations
on the Purification of Boston Sewage,"
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> quote
a suggestion made by
Stoddart (1905):</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Water
Supply and Irrigation Paper No. 185, p. 125.</div>

<p class="blockquot">"He finds, in a septic tank of several compartments, a considerable
deposit of sludge in the first compartment, giving a fairly clear
supernatant liquid, which in the last chamber of all undergoes a
secondary decomposition, leading to the throwing down of an
additional precipitate of offensive sludge."</p>

<p>What took place in the case referred to by Stoddart corresponds to the
author's observations of the liquid leaving the tanks in a clarified
condition, but the secondary decomposition must take place in some
manner, and, when it does, a nuisance seems to be unavoidable where no
provision is made to care for it.</p>
<!--593.png--><p><span class="pagenum">561</span></p>

<p>In view of the experience of others, some further treatment seems to be
necessary. Such treatment should include disinfection, as no method of
disposal yet devised has succeeded in reducing materially the pathogenic
germs usually to be found in sewage and tank effluents.</p>

<p>If the crops to be irrigated are to be eaten, uncooked, by mankind, then
disinfection at least is imperative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George S. Binckley, M. Am. Soc.</span> C. E. (by letter).&mdash;Mr. Conway's
admirable paper is of special interest to the writer, as the entire
general design of the system, as well as the extensive hydrological
studies and final selection of the sources of water supply, was
completed during 1906 through the joint labors of the writer, as Chief
Engineer, and James D. Schuyler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Consulting
Engineer.</p>

<p>In this work, Mr. Schuyler and the writer had the rare privilege of
dealing from its inception with the problem of designing a complete and
somewhat extensive system of municipal water supply and drainage,
unhampered by any existing works to which the new systems would have to
be adapted. It would probably be difficult to find in the United States
a city of 85,000 inhabitants, previously totally lacking either a water
supply or sewerage system, which, under a consistent and harmonious
design, has been provided with both in the degree of completeness and
structural excellence exemplified in the works at Monterrey.</p>

<p>The few important changes or amplifications made in the original design,
and the manner in which its detail has been executed is naturally most
interesting to the writer, and this excellent paper should be of very
substantial value, particularly to engineers engaged on similar work in
Mexico or Spanish America.</p>

<p>The very novel construction method adopted by Mr. Conway in the roofing
of the South or Guadalupe Reservoir, seems to the writer rather to
invite criticism, and the fact that in the subsequent construction of
the roof over the rectangular Obispado Reservoir the customary
monolithic concrete construction was apparently reverted to after
experience with the separate-unit plan previously used, would indicate
that Mr. Conway reached the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The original design of the circular Guadalupe Reservoir contemplated
just about the same arrangement of columns and roof support as that
actually used, but the writer had expected that the columns would be
cast in place, and that the system of primary and secondary beams would
be filled at the same time as, and integral with, the roof slab, the
reinforcement being placed in accordance with what may be described as
conventional practice. The writer believes that the efficiency of the
concrete and steel placed in this manner would be notably higher than
under the system actually adopted, which, in effect, is pretty much the
same as constructing the supporting system of units of cut stone. If,
with all the elements of structural weakness involved in the
multiplicity of mortised joints, discontinuous reinforcement,
<!--594.png--><span class="pagenum">562</span>etc.,
this construction is strong enough, it would seem that an important
reduction in the dimensions of the members could have been effected by
monolithic construction and continuous reinforcement, without sacrifice
of strength.</p>

<p>The comparison, in <a href="#TABLE_7">Table 7</a>, of the costs of these two reservoirs, is
interesting, but very moderately illuminating, as the comparative unit
cost of the most important element in their construction&mdash;the
concrete&mdash;is not given. The total excavation cost for each reservoir is
practically the same, and the general expense, engineering, and cost of
fittings and accessories presumably so, but the total cost of the
Guadalupe Reservoir as given is $19,000 (pesos) in excess of that of the
Obispado Reservoir, while, in the latter, there were 756 cu. m. more
concrete. This certainly indicates a much higher cost of concrete per
unit as laid in the South (Guadalupe) Reservoir. An actual comparison of
the cost per unit of concrete laid under the two systems would be
instructive.</p>

<p>The writer is interested to observe that the same system of sub-drainage
used by him in the construction of the reservoir for the provisional
supply of water from San Geronimo, has been used by the author in the
Obispado Reservoir. This arrangement of drains under the floor of the
reservoir at San Geronimo was devised as a safeguard against damage to
the lining through the accumulation of water inside the impervious bank
against its back.</p>

<p>It was realized that, in such a climate as that of Monterrey, perfect
water-tightness of the lining might be difficult to secure or maintain,
and, if leaks existed, a sudden draft on the contents of the reservoir
might result in serious damage through the static pressure exerted
against the lining of the sides or upward thrust against the floor. In
the writer's opinion, such a system of drains is an important element,
as not alone the fact but the quantity of leakage may be determined, and
danger of saturation of the supporting bank avoided&mdash;a matter of
importance where, as is sometimes the case, the material of such a bank
is unfit to resist the effects of saturation. The author does not state
whether or not this safeguard was omitted in the Guadalupe Reservoir.
Incidentally, however, the matter of saturation of the bank is not
important in either reservoir, as the material of which these banks are
constructed is such that settlement or failure through saturation is out
of the question. It may be remarked, however, that in fixing the angle
of the sides of the Guadalupe Reservoir at 60° the writer contemplated
the same system of constructing the bank as he used in that of the San
Geronimo Reservoir. In this case, the bank was built up by spreading the
material in thin layers, wetting down, and rolling and puddling by the
passage of the ox-carts used for the transportation of the material, the
wheels of the carts, and especially the cloven hoofs of the animals,
producing a most excellent effect. The inside slope
<!--595.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>was built up in
this fashion to a much lower angle, and with a top width considerably in
excess of the finished dimensions. The excess material was then picked
off to the line, and exactly to the slope. Thus the finished slope
presented a surface which was compacted to a degree impossible to attain
at or near the surface of the bank as built, and presenting a support of
the best possible character for the concrete lining and coping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="V_Saucedo" id="V_Saucedo"></a>V. Saucedo, Assoc. M. AM. Soc.</span> C. E. (by letter).&mdash;The author's
description of the water-works and sewerage of Monterrey, one of the
most extensive schemes in Mexico, will be of general interest to
engineers, especially those engaged in hydraulic and sanitary problems.
The writer, having been connected with the works for four years, knows
the local conditions well, and presents herewith some complementary data
on what he considers an important feature, the subject of floods,
mentioned by the author on different occasions, especially as certain
developments in the works show the importance of such occurrences as a
factor in designing.</p>

<p>Abnormal rainfalls of long duration and high intensity are common in the
semi-arid region of Mexico. They come at irregular intervals, though
tending to coincide with the early fall. The floods of August, 1909,
were a repetition of similar occurrences in the past; and, though there
are no numerical records of previous cases, local traditions and
historical state documents describe them as having occurred since the
foundation of the city, at intervals of from 15 to 40 years. The graphic
descriptions of the places flooded are in accord with the character of
the floods of August, 1909, and September, 1910.</p>

<p>The diagram, Fig. 21, is a record of the rainfall during the latter
flood, and was plotted from intermittent readings of standard gauges. It
demonstrates that the intensity increased toward the mountains on the
south, which form the tributary water-shed of the Santa Catarina River,
showing a difference of 10.54 in. between the city and the Estanzuela
Dam, which is not quite 12 miles to the southeast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.&mdash;Rainfall during floods of
September 14th-16th, 1910, in Monterrey.</span></span>
</div>

<p>An estimate of the volume of discharge of the river at the time of
maximum flood is only a reasonable conjecture which (without special
reference to accuracy) aims to impress those who have not witnessed such
occurrences with the tremendous volume coming from barren steep surfaces
previously saturated.</p>

<p>The original computation, referred to by the author, was obtained from
the average of two different methods which gave results close to each
other. In one method the extent and nature of the water-shed were
considered, together with the maximum period of precipitation that
occurred, sufficient to gather a maximum volume of water in the river.
In the other method the volume was derived from a cross-section of the
wetted perimeter of the river at the time of maximum flow, in
combination with velocity approximations obtained by using
<!--596.png--><span class="pagenum">564</span>rough
floats. This gave 271,500 cu. ft. per sec. The figure submitted by the
author, 235,000 cu, ft. per sec., is in accord with the proposed
formula<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for
impervious surfaces by C. E. Gregory, M. Am. Soc. C. E.
In the first and last methods, the intensity, a governing factor, is
more or less of an assumption, and the cross-sectional method is also
unreliable, as the river-bed was greatly disturbed, due to the high
velocity of the water, which deepens the channel to a considerable
extent at times of maximum flood, the gravels being redeposited during
the period of subsidence. Such was the case during the flood of
September, 1910, when the depth of gravel above the roof of the San
Geronimo Infiltration Gallery was diminished to such an extent that it
was so inefficient as a filter for the flood as to permit the
percolation of turbid water into the underground supply.</p>

<p>During the floods of August, 1909, Shafts Nos. 2 and 3 were damaged
beyond repair, and sand and gravel, entering through them,
<!--597.png--><span class="pagenum">565</span>blocked up
the gallery to within about 150 ft. of Shaft No. 1. The interior
timbering probably collapsed, due to cavings and disturbance in the
river-bed during the period of maximum flood, but no explorations have
been possible on account of the great quantity of water still coming
through (at present more than 650 liters per sec.). For this reason the
work of driving the gallery, as well as lining Shaft No. 1, has been
suspended.</p>

</div>

<p>On reaching the city, the flood of August, 1909, swept away two streets
adjoining the river. These streets had been built on made ground, in
what was originally the river-bed. The sewers and water mains laid in
them were destroyed entirely, and some 460 ft. of the 24-in. cast-iron
pipe, buried under the river-bed at a depth of 8 ft., were carried away.
In relaying this portion of the main, and for protecting the remainder
of it across the river, it is now proposed to encase it in a solid
rubble concrete block, 8 ft. square, which will impart weight and
stability against the scouring effect of floods.</p>

<p>The South Reservoir is circular in shape, with an interior diameter of
165.68 ft. at the top, and is partly excavated in the ground and partly
completed by an embankment of vast proportions (<a href="#i507">Fig. 10</a>). Right after
the flood of August, 1909, a wet spot appeared on the northeastern toe
of the embankment, and it was supposed for some time that it was the
effect of the saturation produced by the preceding rains, but, as it
persisted for several months, it was obvious that its origin was in the
interior of the reservoir, which was emptied when the writer took charge
of the work. The first inspection revealed a horizontal crack in the
concrete lining, about 310 ft. long and extending about 153° around the
circumference on the north side. Throughout its length it coincided with
the line of cut and fill. Vertical cracks, coinciding with the panel
points in the lining, had also developed, and extended from the main
horizontal crack to the roof. The circumstances originating this
development can be conjectured by considering the position of the main
crack, its characteristic features, and the conditions that preceded its
formation. The coincidence of the crack with the joint of cut and fill,
points to this line as a source of danger. An examination showed,
besides, that the fracture was clean and sharp, ranging in thickness
from a hair line at the ends to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. at the center, and that its
upper border projected over the lower one perceptibly, a proof that
horizontal motion had taken place. The vertical cracks were a secondary
effect, the consequence of the displacement immediately after it was
scoured. A fracture was discovered in the floor of the reservoir. It
started at the center and branched out into two diverging lines in a
radial direction.</p>

<p>The circumstance of two abnormal rainfalls, giving 35 in. in 9 days, the
precipitation being concentrated in two periods, not far
<!--598.png--><span class="pagenum">566</span>apart, of 42
hours and 98 hours, respectively (<a href="#i485a">Fig. 4</a>), together with lack of
provision for shedding the water from the roof of the reservoir and from
the surrounding embankment, lead to the inference that the latter became
saturated, increasing thereby in weight and decreasing in stability,
especially in its steep inner face. A settlement and the consequent
horizontal displacement, under these conditions, was natural. The
concrete lining, only 16 in. thick at that height, was not sufficient to
sustain the resulting strain, and the main fracture developed,
permitting the stored-up water to leak into the bank. In time this
seepage found its way under the bottom of the reservoir, softening the
ground and producing a slight settlement which caused the crack in the
floor. Had under-drainage been provided, as at the Obispado Reservoir,
the actual conditions would have been noticed earlier. However, as the
embankment is of vast proportions, stable in itself to sustain with a
large margin of safety the weight of the stored-up water, there was no
actual danger of failure, except for the fact that the material forming
the structure, on account of its calcareous nature, is dissolved by
water. Long exposure to this condition would, in time, open passages in
the embankment, and it is certain that there would be cavings in its
interior.</p>

<p>The necessary grouting has been done, and provision is being made for
water-proofing the interior of the reservoir and shedding the water from
the roof and from the embankment, thus relieving the structure of the
consequent strain.</p>

<p>Another place in the works where floods have had a damaging effect is
the Estanzuela intake basin, which, when the dam was completed, was
filled to the overflow level in order to test its water-tightness. As
this basin, when cleaned, was found to be slightly fissured on the north
side, it was decided to line it with concrete. As shown in <a href="#i495">Fig. 8</a>, the
lining does not cover its entire area, but only the central portion,
leaving a strip on either side without protection. The flood of
September, 1910, coming in greater volume than the previous ones of
August, 1909, in passing through the narrow gorge at the entrance,
undermined the lining in those places where it was not founded on solid
rock. Figs. 1, 2, and 3,
Plate XXXIII, show some of the damage caused by this flood. The buoyant
effect of the water and the impact of large rolling boulders caused
fractures all over the surface, and lifted the concrete lining bodily;
but the dam proper, being founded on rock bottom, did not suffer any
injury. In the future, in order to avoid the seepage of the ordinary
supply, alluded to by the author, the water will be carried to the
valve-house in an open rubble concrete channel, lined with cement mortar
and built high up against the western hillside. The remainder of the
basin will be paved with large boulders.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the writer wishes to emphasize the point that,
notwithstanding
<!--601.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>the
severity of the test, relatively small damage was
inflicted on the extensive works carried out under the author's design
and direction. A test so severe that it caused serious damage and
immense losses in the entire region, washing away kilometers of railroad
track and destroying practically all the bridges within reach of the
flood, is an occurrence of paramount importance, and should be
remembered as a leading factor in the design of engineering works.</p>

<div class="tb"></div>


<p><span class="smcap"><a name="George_T_Hammond" id="George_T_Hammond"></a>George T. Hammond, M. AM. Soc.</span> C. E. (by letter).&mdash;In a country, such as
that described in this paper, where water is valuable, and a shortage is
at times possible, where the majority of the population is very poor,
and water and sewage discharge are both to be paid for on a basis of
volume, the question of the expected quantity of daily water supply and
sewage flow per capita is of primary importance. This question,
notwithstanding its difficulty, should be given a first place in the
studies for water-works and sewerage projects, and should never be lost
sight of in the design, which should be such that, while proper for the
expected future flow for a reasonable time, should also be proper and
economical for conditions which at present obtain and may change but
slowly.</p>

<p>It is desirable, of course, to get as much capacity in works as one can
for the outlay, but there are instances where one can get too much for
the money, as where a larger pipe than is necessary is used for a sewer,
merely because it costs about the same as a smaller one, and as a result
the cost of maintenance is permanently increased.</p>

<p>The water-works were designed to supply 40,000,000 liters (10,582,000
gal.) daily, which it was assumed would be sufficient for all future
developments in Monterrey for a population of 200,000 at a per capita
consumption of 200 liters (about 53 gal.) per day. The present
population of the city is given as less than 90,000, there having been
an increase of 22,000 in ten years (1891-1901), but it is evident that
in the last ten years (1901-1911) this rate of increase has not
continued. Taking into account all the data known to the writer, it does
not seem that the city will attain a population of 200,000 in a great
many years, if it ever does; but this is a matter of personal opinion,
and is only stated as such.</p>

<p>The present requirements of the city's population, assuming that each
person uses 200 liters (53 gal.) per day, would be, at that rate, which
is a very liberal one, only 18,000,000 liters (4,762,000 gal.) per day,
or less than half the amount which may be provided.</p>

<p>If the water were not to be metered and the sewage discharge paid for by
measure, it is possible that the free use of water might lead to the
usual waste with which all are fairly familiar; but the use of meters,
and the rates charged, will reduce the water consumption
<!--602.png--><span class="pagenum">568</span>to a minimum.
This end will especially result from Section 5 of the Tariffs which
provides that:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Groups can be formed of two or more small houses so as to obtain a
joint service under the proportion shown in the tariff."</p>

<p>This provision will keep down the per capita supply, among the majority
of the people, to about 37<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> liters (10 gal.) per day. A similar
provision led to abuse in Santiago de Cuba, as well as in other Cuban
cities, where one householder, taking water, frequently delivers it to
adjoining houses and tenements through rubber hose. As many as ten or
twelve families are sometimes found to be supplied from one tap in this
manner. Indeed, it may be stated as a rule, having but few exceptions,
that where water is paid for by meter its use is always restricted.</p>

<p>The water mains and distribution system, however, are so well laid out,
and the whole design is so good, that the writer would not anticipate
much difficulty because it is on rather too liberal lines for the
present or probable future. It may, perhaps, be argued that it may cost
more to keep the mains in such a system clean; but this extra cost will
scarcely be of much moment, and will be offset by the greater lasting
quality of the larger pipes. There is another feature of the problem,
however, which is not affected favorably by a too liberal forecast of
the per capita water supply, namely, the sewerage system.</p>

<p>If it is assumed that, using 200 liters per capita per day, the total
water supply of the city for the present population will be 18,000,000
liters, and that this may double in fifty years, or even amount to
40,000,000 liters in that time, it would seem that a rather liberal
provision has been made for the water supply, and that this will
scarcely be exceeded by the sewage, for the latter must come from the
water supply, there being little or no ground-water and no storm-water
taken into the sewers. Designing the sewers to flow half full for all
diameters less than 18 in., and seven-tenths full for all larger sizes,
it would seem that this would give ample capacity for all time to come
in such a city, and that good practice would not exceed these figures,
it being more desirable that the sewers should not be too large to work
well, than that they should be large enough in all places to meet every
possible contingency. If all the sewers of a system are too large, the
condition is incurably bad; while, if a few miles prove to be too small,
on account of growth and prosperity not anticipated by the designer, it
will be easy enough to relay such parts when this becomes necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway states that:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The sewers are designed on a very liberal basis, namely, on the
assumption that when flowing half full the quantity to be dealt with
will be 380 liters [100 gal.] per capita per day, with a maximum rate of
flow of 200 per cent."</p>
<!--603.png--><p><span class="pagenum">569</span></p>

<p>If the writer understands this statement correctly, it means that the
sewers, flowing half full, will carry 380 liters per capita in 12 hours,
or are designed with 200% of the capacity required to take the assumed
flow in 24 hours.</p>

<p>It was assumed that each house would be occupied by 7 persons and have a
frontage of 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> m. (about 41 ft.), that is, about 700 gal. per day
per house, the maximum flow rate being 200%, or at the rate of 700 gal.
per house in 12 hours.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that nearly all the houses are of one story, and
that, as a rule in tropical and sub-tropical countries, the per capita
use of water diminishes with some function of the increasing number of
inhabitants in one house. Most of the water is used in the kitchen, and
where there are 7 persons instead of 5, the quantity used by the smaller
number will generally serve the larger.</p>

<p>The writer is unable to understand how this quantity of sewage will be
produced, especially as the author states that, as far as the company is
concerned, it is limited to the removal and disposal of the sewage, and
is not required to provide for storm-water. He also states that:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Apart from that fact, however, the best system for a city like
Monterrey, where rainfall for many months at a time is very scarce, is
the strictly 'separate system'."</p>

<p>The minimum velocities in the sewers, when running full, vary between
0.91 and 1.5 m. (from 3 to 5 ft.) per sec., and will be the same flowing
half full.</p>

<p>From the foregoing data it will be observed that:</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">(1) The water supply is the only source from which sewage flow is
anticipated;</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">(2) The water supply is very liberally estimated at 200 liters (53
gal.) per capita daily;</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">(3) For purposes of sewer design, the daily flow of sewage expected
(all of which is derived from the water supply of 200 liters per
capita) is estimated at 380 liters per capita, with a maximum rate
of flow of 200% (or at the rate of 760 liters per capita), and
with this quantity the sewers are designed to flow only half full;</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">(4) The gradients are such that a velocity of from 3 to 5 ft. (0.91 to
1.5 m.) per sec. will be secured in the sewers flowing half full
with the above quantity of flow per capita.
</p>

<p>The writer does not agree with this method of computation, as he feels
sure that it will give sewers which are too large, with grades too steep
for the best obtainable results. His experience, extending over more
than twenty years in sewer design and hydraulic work, convinces him that
the method pursued is wrong in principle.</p>

<p>The principles involved in sewer design are first of all hydraulic. The
quantity of flow, in the nature of things, cannot be forecasted
<!--604.png--><span class="pagenum">570</span>accurately;
success depends on getting the nearest possible
approximation to average conditions. If 200 liters per capita per day is
a liberal allowance, and 40,000,000 liters per day is a liberal
expectation at this rate for double the present population, and the
sewers are designed to flow half full only, why should this again be
doubled?</p>

<p>The design of a sewer system for a city such as Monterrey is, in fact, a
very difficult problem, especially as the quantity of sewage will be
very limited, flush-water will have to be used in considerable
quantities, and water in that part of the world is precious at all times
and often scarce. Under these circumstances, the size or shape of the
pipes selected for the lateral sewers, should have been such as would
more nearly agree with the requirements than does the 8-in. circular.</p>

<p>A. P. Folwell, M. Am. Soc. C. E., writing of the 8-in. circular size,
states:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> "Sewerage," by A. P. Folwell, M. Am, Soc. C. E.</div>

<p class="blockquot">"To secure a flow in this pipe having an average depth of 4 inches would
require the sewage from a population of 6,500. In general it may be said
that the ordinary depth of flow in any sewer should not be less than 2
inches, nor should it be less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the radius of the invert, since
if it is so there is much more danger of deposits forming along the
edges and even in the center of the stream. It will sometimes be
impossible to meet this requirement fully, but it should be kept in mind
as extremely desirable."</p>

<p>Sewers of small size should be proportioned throughout the system so
that the depth of the minimum daily flow in the invert, and the velocity
of flow, will be the best possible to prevent deposits. The transporting
power of water is dependent mainly on the depth of flow, a minimum
velocity being selected rather than a minimum depth of flow. To those
who have had charge of the maintenance of sewers, as well as of their
design and construction, this principle seems so obvious that it is
always a surprise to see it disregarded by designers, who in these days
seem inclined to consider sewerage as a system of grades and sizes of
pipes installed for ideal, rather than for actual, conditions. Messrs.
Staley and Pierson have well stated the principle involved as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A stream having a depth of flow sufficient to immerse solid matter held
in suspension, to a certain extent lifts it and carries it forward. The
entire surface is also exposed to the action of the current. A stream
having an equal velocity but a less depth in proportion to the diameter
of the solid matters to be transported, evidently has less transporting
power. * * * An amount of sewage which can be properly transported by a
circular sewer of a given size, cannot be as efficiently transported by
one of larger diameter."</p>

<p>From some strange idea, which is apparently without foundation in logic
or based on any actual justification from experience, it has of late
years become the practice of designing engineers to make the
<!--605.png--><span class="pagenum">571</span>8-in.
circular pipe the smallest size for sewers; and it is not improbable
that the designer of the Monterrey system has merely followed this
example. It has also become the frequent practice of designers to give
every length of sewer all the grade possible, regardless of the fact,
taught both by hydraulics and experience, that the best grade is that
which will give as much depth of flow as is consistent with a scouring
velocity.</p>

<p>Some years ago it was the standard practice, in the "strictly separate
system" of sewers, to use the 6-in. pipe as the minimum size, and, as
far as the writer has been able to discover, after giving the matter a
rather extensive investigation, the 6-in. size has given excellent
results wherever its use was proper. In places where it has not
succeeded there were excellent reasons why it should not have been
selected, and these could easily have been observed at the time the
designs were made. The best sizes for the sewers in a given system is
always a matter to be determined by local conditions; but there seems to
be no reason why the 6-in. size should not be used where the flow is so
slight that the 8-in. will not work well; or where the velocity must of
necessity be so great that a flotation depth of flow cannot be
maintained in the larger size. As to likelihood of clogging and
stoppage, the writer's opinion, based on the maintenance of three rather
extensive systems in different parts of the United States, in each of
which the 6-in. size comprises more than 75% of the whole length of
pipe, and of three other systems, one having 12-in. and two having 8-in.
as the minimum sizes, is that the 6-in. size, where properly used, is
less likely to become clogged than either of the others used improperly.
The cost of maintaining the 6-in. pipe lateral, under these
circumstances, is much less than that of maintaining the 8-in. lateral.</p>

<p>The 6-in. pipe is not being used now as much as the 8-in., and in most
cases this is probably because the capacity of the latter is nearly
double that of the 6-in., and costs only a few cents more per foot. If
there is a sufficient population per acre, or if, within 30 or 40 years,
such a population is anticipated as will fill the 8-in. pipe half full,
its use, of course, is justified and necessary; but where it is quite
evident that this will never occur, its use is counter-indicated.</p>

<p>In Monterrey, where the building lots have a frontage of 41 ft., where
the houses, as a rule, are only one story high, where the water service
is metered and paid for, and the sewage flow is also paid for, there
seems to be no reason to justify the use of 8-in. pipe for the upper
reaches of the smallest sewers. The sewage flow to be anticipated will
probably never be sufficient to keep an 8-in. pipe sewer in a good clean
condition at the upper ends of the lines of sewers without excessive
flushing; and the sharper or steeper the grade on which it is placed,
the worse will be the result, because the sharper the
<!--606.png--><span class="pagenum">572</span>grade, the
thinner the flowing thread of sewage will be drawn out in the invert; on
the other hand, if the grades are flat, the slight quantity of sewage
flow will be spread out in a sluggish stream, without sufficient depth,
on the bottom of the 8-in. pipe.</p>

<p>Where a wide surface is given to a small quantity of flowing sewage, it
stagnates slowly along the bottom of the sewer, leaving frequent
deposits to undergo decomposition and create foul air, if not to choke
the sewer, a result often produced; and where a circular sewer which is
too large for the ordinary flow is given a strong velocity by using
steep grades, the stream, though flowing rapidly, is drawn out to such a
thin thread that it will not effect the flotation of the solid masses in
the sewage brought in at house connections, and the shallow and thin
stream simply flows around such masses until a dam or obstruction forms
and the sewage is backed up sufficiently to force the obstruction
farther down, to form another obstruction in a larger pipe below.
Flushing may possibly keep such a sewer fairly clean; but, as usually
practiced, it is effective only for a few hundred feet from the
flush-tank; and the quantity of flush-water required by an 8-in. pipe is
more than twice as much as that required to keep the 6-in. pipe clean.
Ventilation is better in the smaller sewer than in the larger, as there
is less air to move; but the elaborate ventilating stacks provided at
Monterrey may take care of this; and it is evidently a place where
ventilation will be needed.</p>

<p>The ideal size and shape of cross-section for a sewer is such as will
give the best flotation to moving solids which are being carried along
by the flow; and this means the sewer that, with the expected ordinary
or average flow, will give the best depth in the invert, when the
velocity of flow is sufficient to keep suspended solids, grit, etc.,
moving at a rate of from 2 to 3 ft. per sec. The size, however, is
limited by practical considerations. The circular pipes cannot well be
less than 6 in. in diameter, because the house connections cannot well
be less than 4-in. pipe, and the sewer should be larger than the house
connections, for various practical reasons; but, in order to secure
flotation and a scouring flow, the smallest pipe, or the pipe having the
smallest invert radius, that practical considerations permit, should be
selected. The grade should be such, and the collecting system so laid
out, that the flow may be conserved as far as possible, and the sewage
flow should be kept of as great a depth in the invert, or bottom of the
sewer, as safety in self-cleansing velocity will permit. This will save
flush-water and prevent stoppages, and thus reduce the cost of
maintenance to a minimum. For good sanitary practice, the sewers should
be designed, first of all, to comply with the requirements of the
present, or immediately expected, ordinary flow, with some reasonable
allowance for the future. They should be
<!--607.png--><span class="pagenum">573</span>neither
too large nor too
small, and the grade should neither be too great nor too little, to
secure the best flotation and scouring effects and the best flush-wave
action under all circumstances.</p>

<p>The use of cement concrete pipe for sewers seems to be growing in favor;
nor is this surprising, in view of the many improvements made in their
design and manufacture. The excellence of the concrete pipe used in
Monterrey and its success, suggest the query: Why was it not used still
more extensively?</p>

<p><a href="#TABLE_13">Table 13</a> shows that the cement pipe cost much less than the vitrified
tile, or "fire-clay" pipe. Thus, the 38.1 cm. (15-in.) fire-clay cost
6.14 pesos per lin. m., the 45.7 cm. (18-in.) cost 8.80 pesos, and the
50.8 cm. (20-in.) cost 11.30 pesos. Compared with this, the concrete
pipe was much the cheaper; the 55.9 cm. (22-in.) cost 5.93 pesos, which
is less than the cost of the 38.1 cm. (15-in.) fire-clay; and the 61.0
cm. (25-in.) concrete pipe cost 7.30 pesos, which is less than the 45.7
cm. (18-in.) fire-clay.</p>

<p>The writer's experience with concrete pipe, derived mainly from a long
service in sewer design and construction in Brooklyn, N. Y., leads him
to believe that at Monterrey the whole sewer system might, with
advantage, have been built of concrete pipe, using an egg-shaped pipe
with an area slightly larger than an 8-in. circle, designed for a
discharge equal to an 8-in. pipe for all the smaller sewers. The invert
of such an egg-shaped pipe would fulfill the present requirements in
carrying a very small flow with good flotation depth, better than would
a 6-in. circular pipe, and the reserve capacity of the 8-in. pipe would
be secured without interfering with good present service. Egg-shaped
pipes, similar to those used in Brooklyn, the writer believes, would
have given far better satisfaction throughout the Monterrey sewerage
system than circular fire-clay pipe, and would have cost no more, but
probably less. The egg-shaped pipe referred to is made with a flat base
and a self-centering joint, thus insuring perfect alignment, and a
smoother interior surface than can be obtained with fire-clay pipes.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has about 450 miles of concrete pipe sewers, of all sizes less
than 24 in., the greater part of which is egg-shaped. There are also
about 250 miles of vitrified stoneware circular pipe sewers of similar
sizes, and the cost of repairs and replacing pipe, over a period of
years is about the same per mile for each kind. Incidentally, it may be
stated that the annual cost of repairs per mile on both kinds of pipe is
very small, and is only about one-fifth of the cost of repairs per mile
on the brick sewers, of which there are about 200 miles.</p>

<p>The principal advantages and disadvantages of cement concrete pipe
sewers may be summed up as follows:</p>
<!--608.png--><p><span class="pagenum">574</span></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Advantages of Concrete Pipe</span>.</div>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(a) Cement concrete pipe is usually less costly than vitrified pipe.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(b) It can be formed in any shape desired.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(c) It is not cracked by vibration, and resists impact better than
vitrified pipe, for which reason it is a better material to lay
near the surface of a street in which there is heavy traffic.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(d) It is not affected by ordinary sewage.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(e) The cost of repairing and maintaining is about the same as for a
vitrified pipe sewer.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(f) It can be made in the city or town where it is to be installed,
thus giving the locality the advantage of having some of the money
paid for labor in its manufacture spent in the place where the
sewers are being put in, where it is raised as a tax, etc.; also
saving freight charges, etc.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(g) It can be made under the most careful local supervision and
inspection, of selected material, by the engineer who is
responsible for the success of the work. Vitrified pipe can seldom
be made in this way.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Disadvantages of Concrete Pipe</span>.</div>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(a) If not carefully made and of the best of materials, it is subject
to failure by disintegration, etc.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(b) It will not stand strong chemical action, and therefore the
smaller sizes should not be used where they are likely to be
exposed to trade wastes containing strong acids. In the larger
sizes the quantity of flow mixes so quickly with the trade wastes
that this danger is minimized, and it is very seldom that even the
smaller sizes become affected; but vitrified pipe may be used in
places where chemical action is anticipated.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(c) If not properly made, it will be attacked by steam and hot vapor,
and by animal fats in the sewage; but, if properly made, it is not
affected by these.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(d) Unless reinforced or made very thick, it will not stand as great a
crushing load as the best vitrified stoneware pipe; but, as sewers
are not intended to be used under very heavy pressure, this is not
so very important. It is amply strong to withstand any internal
pressure or any external crushing load to which it probably will
be submitted.</p>

<p class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em;">
(e) Under a considerable head of ground-water, it may permit water to
infiltrate through its walls for a considerable time after it is
laid, thereby temporarily increasing the flow, which, if the
sewage is to be pumped, will increase the cost of pumping. This
difficulty can be met by using a carefully selected mix of
materials in making the pipe, and by making
<!--609.png--><span class="pagenum">575</span>the joints carefully.
Infiltration through concrete diminishes rapidly after the sewer
is in use; it occurs in vitrified pipe, also, to some extent.</p>

<p>The house connection drain adopted in Monterrey, with the disconnecting
trap, is very much like one which the writer has seen introduced with
very bad result. These are being removed as rapidly as possible by one
of his clients, a sewerage company, in the Southern States. It has been
a fruitful cause of stoppages and bad smells; the ordinary method now in
general use is much better. In the design shown, it would seem that
there may even be some danger that the ventilation of the sewer by the
stand-pipes in the streets may force the traps.</p>

<p>One is rather surprised to learn that the main outfall sewer is designed
with a capacity of 90,000,000 liters per day, the present sewage being
estimated as not more than 18,000,000 liters, and the far future being
thought to require only 40,000,000 liters. Why this excessive size?
Possibly the surplus water which it is to carry is to be discharged into
the sewers from the water supply system direct, and is intended for
irrigating the land at the disposal area, when the sewage is
insufficient for this purpose. The author states that all surface water
is strictly excluded.</p>

<p>The method of sewage disposal gives rise to several questions. It is
proposed to use an extensive area for growing crops, which are to be
irrigated with sewage. The paper states that the underlying strata at
Monterrey contain numerous caverns, and the first question is: What will
be the effect on the water supply of other towns lower down the valley?
The writer recollects a serious outbreak of typhoid fever in Bluefield,
W. Va., caused by the pollution of the water in similar strata finding
its way through unknown underground caverns and channels to the city's
water supply.</p>

<p>The next question is: What crops will be grown? It is a well-known fact
that vegetables grown by the use of sewage as a fertilizer, are unsafe
in a raw state for human consumption. This is well-known to European
travelers in China and Japan, where the use of fecal matter as
fertilizer renders the various water supplies (where not filtered and
disinfected) and all green vegetables, unsafe, on account of typhoid
germs. Moreover, crops not intended for human consumption, which are
grown on lands irrigated by sewage bearing typhoid germs, etc., are
unsafe for men to handle; even to store them may cause a dissemination
of disease. It is evident, therefore, that the whole sewage flow should
be in some manner disinfected at least, if not filtered, before it is
used.</p>

<p>The method of sewage disposal and the use of merely settled septic
sewage for irrigation seem to be open to objection. The disposal plant
is not sufficiently effective to meet the present requirements of
sanitary
<!--610.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>science;
and the sludge-pit will be certain to breed a pest of
flies, if it is not also an intolerable nuisance on account of foul
smells. Monterrey would seem to be a proper place for the introduction
of the Imhoff tank, with percolating filters, and a final settling tank,
the effluent being disinfected, before entering the latter tank. The
flow might then be used safely for irrigation purposes for crops not to
be eaten uncooked by man. The writer does not see how the method
provided can possibly fulfill the object stated, to distribute on the
land an effluent which will be "innocuous and clear," or how any
consequential degree of purification can be obtained in the tanks
provided.</p>

<p>While there are described in this paper many things to find fault with,
there are also many things to commend. The water supply system, with its
reservoirs, etc., seems to be admirable; and the methods of construction
by which the expense for forms was reduced is very interesting. The
parking and ornamentation of the grounds over the reservoir roofs cannot
fail to benefit the people and popularize the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Rudolf_Meyer" id="Rudolf_Meyer"></a>Rudolf Meyer, M. AM. Soc</span>. C. E. (by letter).&mdash;The writer, as Engineer
for the Government (guaranteeing the concessionaires a gross return of
10% per annum on the capital invested), and as inspector of the various
works has had exceptional opportunities to become acquainted, not only
with their construction, but also with events leading up to the granting
of the final concession under which they were built and will be
extended. In order to judge of the extent to which the different
engineers, in their turn contributed toward the design of these works,
the writer has thought it desirable to submit a complete statement of
all matters relating to the inception, investigations, surveys, tests,
etc., previous to the adoption of the present plans.</p>

<p>Data regarding former investigations, plans, and concessions which have
since lapsed, have been obtained from the Government archives. These
refer to periods prior to Mr. Conway's engagement, and anterior to the
retaining of Mr. Schuyler by the concessionaires, and Mr. Binckley's
connection with the scheme, and they are presented here as complementary
to the information in the paper.</p>

<p>Samuel M. Gray, M. Am. Soc. C. E., acting in the interest of some
American capitalists (who had been induced by Col. J. A. Robertson, of
Monterrey, to look into the merits of a concession acquired by him, for
building these works), being guided by the Government's proposition to
supply the city with water by damming the flood-waters of the Santa
Catarina River in the narrow gorge through which the stream emerges from
the Sierras, some eight miles from the city, had several soundings made
and reservoir sites surveyed in the first two box cañons up the river,
and prepared and presented to the Government several alternative
projects, besides the one mentioned by Mr. Schuyler. Several different
dam sites were designated by Mr.
<!--611.png--><span class="pagenum">577</span>Gray,
whose investigations extended
over some two years, and were finally abandoned after he had designed
the general outlay for a complete network of water mains and sewers for
the city, on account of the unwillingness of the Government at that
time, about 1897, to grant any guaranties as to bonds or income to the
concessionaire or his assigns. Mr. Gray did not favor the general scheme
of storing flood-waters as a water supply, but strongly recommended to
the attention of the Government the greater advantages of deriving the
supply from subterranean flow in the river, by an infiltration gallery
driven into the water-bearing gravels in the Santa Catarina Cañon (only
a short distance above the place where Mr. Binckley afterward
established his bore-holes across the river). He proposed to take
advantage of the steep slope of the river at a turn in the cañon, and
from the lower end drive a tunnel through a projecting rock spur, which
tunnel, though starting well above the ordinary reach of floods, would
terminate in water-bearing gravel, at a sufficient depth below the
surface of the river-bed to intercept part of the underflow. Mr. Gray,
through investigations made under his direction, by Nathaniel Turner, M.
Am. Soc. C. E., had ascertained that there was an abundant subterranean
flow, and work had actually been started on the proposed tunnel.</p>

<p>The results of Mr. Gray's investigations were put at the disposal of
Messrs. Mackenzie, Mann &amp; Co. by Mr. Robertson, at whose offices Mr.
Binckley prepared the first plans submitted by him for the approval of
the Government.</p>

<p>After Mr. Gray's investigations, Messrs. Mackin and Dillon (F. H.
Dillon, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.), under contract with the Government,
prepared the following plans: For a dam in the Santa Catarina Cañon; for
a pipe line, similar to the one proposed by Mr. Gray, to a reservoir and
settling basin on the left bank of the river (a short distance above
where the provisional pumping station was established afterward by Mr.
Binckley), but on the flat above the bluff skirting the river,
practically at the same elevation as the present high-pressure
reservoirs; for a complete network of water mains and sewers in the
city, indicating the approximate direction in which the sewage would be
disposed of, either by turning it into the river or by spreading it over
suitable lands, the location of which was to be determined later; and
also a complete set of specifications.</p>

<p>On these data bids were invited by publication, and inquiries were
received from several parties. Finally, Messrs. Stocker and Walker, of
Scranton, Pa., entered into negotiations with the Government, and the
present concession was agreed upon and granted.</p>

<p>Messrs. Stocker and Walker engaged the late E. Sherman Gould, M. Am.
Soc. C. E., to prepare a plan for a storage dam in the Santa Catarina
Cañon, and submitted plans for water distribution and sewers
<!--612.png--><span class="pagenum">578</span>in the
city, slightly modifying the original plans of Messrs. Mackin and
Dillon.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1905, the concession was acquired by Messrs. Mackenzie,
Mann &amp; Co., of Toronto, Canada, together with all plans, etc., presented
by the original concessionaires. The new concessionaires stated that
they would examine the whole situation again, for the purpose of
presenting modified plans for works.</p>

<p>Mr. Schuyler, in the interest of the new owners, had paid one flying
visit to Monterrey when Mr. Gray's projects were brought to his notice,
and the writer had an opportunity to show him the tunnel which had been
started. Mr. Schuyler left for Brazil and did not return until February,
1906, when he was accompanied by the Chief Engineer appointed by the
concessionaires. Messrs. Schuyler and Binckley then prepared plans for
the water distribution and sewer systems in the city and for a
provisional water supply to be pumped at San Geronimo, some two miles up
the river. The new plans for the city work followed closely the general
disposition by Mr. Gray, the principal difference being that the main
reservoirs for the permanent water supply were located to the south
instead of to the west. This change was due to the results of an
investigation, made during Mr. Schuyler's absence in Brazil, by Mr. F.
S. Hyde, late Hydraulic Engineer of the Necaxa Water Power plant, who,
accompanied by the writer, visited the whole water-shed of the Santa
Catarina River in October, 1905, in search of suitable dam sites and
prospects of power development. Mr. Hyde extended his studies to the
Santiago Cañon, southeast of the city, recommending finally that the
water be brought from that cañon, and that wells be dug in different
points of the Santa Catarina River between San Geronimo and the entrance
of the cañon, and tested by pumping, for the purpose of establishing
levels and ascertaining the available amount of underflow, with a view
of determining the location for an infiltration gallery high enough up
the river to permit of a gravity delivery and under good pressure in the
city.</p>

<p>In view of Mr. Hyde's report, and as the result of a visit to the
Santiago Cañon, Mr. Schuyler decided to locate the reservoirs south of
the town, intending to bring in water from the southeast, from springs
in the Santiago Cañon, and also by infiltration from Santa Catarina, his
and Mr. Binckley's scheme of water supply being for the same pressure
throughout the city.</p>

<p>To supply water during construction, and partly meet the demands of the
city, Mr. Binckley, on his arrival, decided to establish a provisional
pumping station at the well in the river nearest to town, started by
direction of Mr. Hyde at San Geronimo. This well was situated within the
bed of inundation of high floods, on a low bank, at the foot of a
conglomerate bluff some 20 ft. high, limiting a flat which was above the
reach of any flood. It was on the same side of the river
<!--613.png--><span class="pagenum">579</span>as the city,
and there was plenty of good ground on the flat above for the
establishment of a reservoir.</p>

<p>A slightly shorter pipe line was secured by crossing the river, building
the reservoir (a substantial concrete-lined and vaulted-over structure)
on the opposite bank, laying out the pipe line to follow that bank
nearly to the city, and finally crossing back again; but the result has
been that since the flood of August, 1909, in which the river crossings
were destroyed, the reservoir remains isolated on the other side of the
river from town, though intended to form part of the permanent works and
act as a compensating reservoir for equalizing the pressure of the
high-pressure system. Fortunately, the pumping station, the larger
pumps, and the boilers, had been moved up the bank (after a rapid rise
in the river on August 10th, 1909) to the new wells established by Mr.
Conway on the line of the proposed prolongation of the infiltration
gallery. The reservoir, however, is left to stand alone on the other
side of the river, and its usefulness will not be restored until a new
line is laid across the river, re-establishing its connection with the
new pump line and the new and permanent pipe line to be laid along the
north bank from the pumping station to the city. This will free
Monterrey from the constant menace of a water famine. At present its two
main water supplies may be cut off by unexpected floods like those of
1909 and 1910, as both supplies are carried across the river, and though
only the cast-iron pipe connecting with the water supply from Estanzuela
was carried away by the flood, the concrete conduit of the San Geronimo
low-pressure supply was seriously threatened. Such risks are too great
to be carried for any length of time; besides, a succession of dry years
would cause such a reduction in the Estanzuela supply as to require an
additional reserve in the way of pumping stations drawing on the
under-flow of the river, such as already exists in San Geronimo.</p>

<p>Afterward, Messrs. Schuyler and Binckley submitted preliminary plans and
profiles for the projected concrete gravity conduit from Estanzuela to
the reservoir south of the city, and Mr. Binckley submitted excavation
plans for two reservoirs, only one of which was built, and from designs
by Mr. Conway.</p>

<p>Stephen E. Kieffer, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was intrusted by Mr. Binckley
with the revision of the plans of the water distribution and sewers. The
southern half was approved by the Government and executed according to
his plans; the northern part was afterward revised by Mr. Conway and has
been partly built.</p>

<p>The final maturing of the project of an infiltration gallery in San
Geronimo as a low-pressure gravity supply, the division of the city into
high- and low-pressure districts corresponding to the two supplies, with
one reservoir, instead of two to the south of the city, and the other to
the west at the Obispado, the entire details of both these gravity
<!--614.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>schemes,
and of the whole sewage disposal scheme, as well as the
modification introduced into the city work for the northern half, are
unquestionably due to Mr. Conway, independently of the general views
which may have been held on those points by other engineers.</p>

<p>In March, 1910, Mr. Conway left Monterrey, all the principal works being
finished. Since that time Vicente Saucedo, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., has
put in many additional water mains and sewers in the northern part of
the city, and is finishing the <i>force majeure</i> work caused by the
destruction wrought in the districts along the river banks by the
extraordinary floods.</p>

<p>The writer, having had an opportunity to watch the earnest efforts of
the several engineers connected with these works, in the course of their
design and construction, resulting without doubt in being the first of
their kind built in Mexico, has been induced to contribute this
discussion in order to bring out clearly the share of each.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitkethly's apprehensions as to the adequacy of the system of
ventilation adopted have not been realized, in part perhaps because the
houses, though generally of only one story, have such high ceilings that
the tops of their vent pipes are generally higher than the ventilating
columns at the heads of the branch sewers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="George_Robert_Graham_Conway" id="George_Robert_Graham_Conway"></a>George Robert Graham Conway, M. AM. Soc</span>. C. E. (by letter).&mdash;The writer
regrets that some features of the works described in this paper have
failed to call forth the many useful criticisms which he expected, and
his remarks, therefore, are limited to the few points which have been
raised. He is particularly indebted to Messrs. Schuyler, Meyer, and
Saucedo for adding supplementary information of value to the paper, but
regrets that he cannot support Mr. Binckley in his claim that "the
entire general design of the system, as well as the extensive
hydrological studies and final selection of the sources of water supply,
was completed in 1906," etc. On May 1st, 1907, when the writer assumed
responsibility as Chief Engineer, he was unfortunately confronted with
the fact that very little data and only a few preliminary and incomplete
plans were available. His first duty was to report upon the final
sources of supply, and the recommendations made in his report (dated
July 12th), received Mr. (now Sir William) Mackenzie's approval during
the same month. The final plans, upon which the approval of the State
Government was definitely obtained, were prepared by the writer during
the summer of 1907, were submitted to the Governor of the State, Gen.
Bernard Reyes, on October 19th, and received his approval on December
12th, 1907. No works, with a long preliminary history, such as those at
Monterrey, can rightly be said to be due to any one individual; many
engineers contributed to the final result, and the writer willingly
acknowledges his indebtedness to the able men, who, for ten years prior
to the construction of the
<!--615.png--><span class="pagenum">581</span>works,
investigated the particular problems
which were met&mdash;problems which were not only of an engineering and
physical nature, but racial and financial. The responsibility of
constructing the works in their present form, and leaving them
practically complete, did, however, fall on the writer's shoulders.</p>

<p>Messrs. Pitkethly and Hammond have criticized the basis of the
calculations upon which the sewer system was laid down. In considering
this problem, it is necessary to remember that, in designing this
system, there was practically no information upon which to base the
calculations; and the writer believed that the wisest course was to
anticipate a liberal growth, and provide a large margin of safety. In
designing a sewer system in older and well-established communities, the
engineer is generally able to compile considerable information regarding
the probable sewage flow for which it is necessary to provide. In
Monterrey this quantity was absolutely unknown. The writer's practice in
other places has been to assume that about 8% of the total daily
discharge of sewage will flow off in one hour; and, from many curves
which he has plotted regarding sewage flow in British towns, this rate
appears to him to be approximately correct. In Monterrey, however, the
old Mexican traditions are rapidly changing, and the city is now
becoming one of the most Americanized in Mexico; the old one-story
houses will give way in time to buildings of several stories&mdash;a change,
already noticeable, which has occurred during the past few years,
particularly in the business portion of the city. Taking these facts
into consideration, it is believed that it would be, not only bad
engineering, but bad business, for a company whose concession lasts 99
years, to provide sewers as small as 6 in., as Mr. Hammond would
recommend, and then be called upon, under the terms of the concession,
to relay larger sewers at a future date, thus incurring further capital
expenditure upon which no Government guaranty would apply, and no
further revenue be obtained. In matters of this kind, not only the
engineering, but the commercial, aspect of the question must be kept in
view, and this point, the writer must frankly admit, he has always
seriously considered.</p>

<p>The writer's experience with reference to the method of ventilating
sewers by tall columns extends over many years, and he still maintains
that no other system gives such satisfactory results. In this view he
finds considerable support in a recent paper on "Salisbury Drainage," by
Mr. W. J. E.
Binnie,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> written
since the system at Monterrey was
installed, in which the result of a series of experiments carried on
during 1906-07 are given. At Salisbury, England, 68 ventilators, 6 in.
in internal diameter, 30 ft. high, were connected to the main sewer by
6-in. stoneware pipes. They were placed about 540 ft. apart,
<!--616.png--><span class="pagenum">582</span>and, from
careful anemometer readings, the following conclusions were reached:</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11">
<span class="label">[11]</span></a> <i>Minutes of Proceedings</i>, Inst. C. E., Vol. CLXXXI, p.
317.</div>

<p class="blockquot">"(1) That four ventilators all lying in the lower portion of the town
acted sometimes as air-inlets and sometimes as air-outlets, and that the
other sixty-four acted as air-outlets.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"(2) That the average velocity of the air escaping up these columns was
3.2 feet per second, representing the circulation of 3,600,000 cubic
feet of air per diem, or sufficient to change the air in the sewers
every 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"(3) That the average velocity of the current of air in the
ventilating-column increases with the size of the sewer to which it is
connected, averaging 2.4 feet per second with the 7-inch sewer, 3.6 feet
per second with the 9-inch sewer, 3.7 feet per second with the 12-inch
sewer, and 4.1 feet per second with the 15-inch sewer in these
experiments.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"(4) That the draught in the column is very largely dependent on the
wind, being at its minimum on a still day, and could therefore be
readily increased by the use of a suitable cowl.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"(5) That the draught is very little affected by the sewer-gradients. It
was expected that, in ventilating-columns placed in connection with the
upper end of a sewer laid at a steep gradient, a strong draught would
have been obtained. No direct connection, however, was traceable."</p>

<p>As the result of these experiments, Mr. Binnie rightly came to the
conclusion that this system of ventilation was efficient.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond anticipates that the house connection trap system at
Monterrey will lead to bad results, but the writer has seen the system
at work in many widely different cities with excellent results. He
believes that it is in accord with the best practice of the most eminent
sanitarians during the last 20 years, and has no apology to make for
introducing that system in Monterrey.</p>

<p>Regarding Mr. Hammond's summary of the advantages of concrete pipes for
sewer construction, the writer is in entire agreement, and would
willingly have introduced them throughout the whole of the Monterrey
system, but for the fact that it was an exceedingly difficult matter to
obtain suitable sand for their manufacture during the early days of
construction, and considerable delays would have arisen if a complete
network of such pipes had been used. His later experience at Monterrey,
when the sand difficulty had been solved, clearly showed that concrete
pipe could be laid down at much less expense than fire clay.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Pitkethly and Mr. Hammond refer to the system of liquefying
tanks used at Monterrey preparatory to turning the sewage on the
irrigation lands, and both express doubts as to their efficiency. The
writer is now separated from his library and notes by many thousands of
miles, and cannot quote "chapter and verse" as accurately as he would
like, in order to support his views that the system adopted
<!--617.png--><span class="pagenum">583</span>was
adequate for dealing with a system such as that at Monterrey. It must be
pointed out that not only was it intended to prevent the sewage from
becoming a nuisance, but that the sewage flow plus a large quantity of
surplus water was intended to be used profitably for irrigation
purposes. With that object, the Company&mdash;or rather its allied Company,
the Monterrey Railway, Light, and Power Company&mdash;obtained the control of
2,246 acres of the very finest arable land, with almost perfect natural
drainage conditions, so that this land could be utilized to create a
profitable revenue from the use of the sewage. The outfall sewer was
accordingly designed to carry sufficient water and sewage to irrigate
about 2,500 acres of land, which area could be considerably extended if
necessary at any future time.</p>

<p>Most authorities now agree that before turning sewage upon land, a
preliminary treatment is required to remove as much as possible of the
suspended matter, and then reduce the latter by subsidence in liquefying
or septic tanks, so that the quantity remaining in the effluent is so
small and finely divided that it may be readily decomposed and oxidized
by bacterial action without risk of clogging the surface or interstices
of the land upon which it may discharge.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12">
<span class="label">[12]</span></a> See Raikes, "Sewage Disposal Works," pages 97-98.</div>

<p>Mr. Pitkethly quotes Messrs. Watson and O'Shaughnessy as saying, in
their evidence before the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal, that not
more than 10% of the solids are digested in septic tanks, but it must be
remembered that in many other places evidence was given before the same
Commission showing that from 25 to 30% was actually obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. J. D. Watson, in his paper, "Birmingham Sewage-Disposal Works,"
<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
read in March, 1910, points out that:</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> <i>Minutes
 of Proceedings</i>, Inst. C. E., Vol. CLXXXI, p.
259.</div>

<p>"The much-maligned sewage-farm still may be allowed (where the
conditions are favourable) to rank as one of the best methods of
sewage-disposal. Diverse opinions may be held as to what are favourable
conditions, particularly as conditions are sure to vary widely with
locality; but it may be assumed that where there is 1 acre of suitable
land per 100 persons, as in Berlin and several other important cities,
the efficiently-worked sewage-farm, when judged solely by the standard
of the effluent produced, is still in the front rank. Effluents from
such a farm are remarkable for their paucity of micro-organisms, their
low albuminoid ammonia, and their unvarying character."</p>

<p>Assuming that not more than 2,000 acres of the irrigated land at
Monterrey were available for sewage purposes, this area would represent
the sewage treatment of the present population of not more than 45
persons per acre, and on the basis of the design, that is, for a
population of 200,000 persons, this represents not more than 100 persons
per acre. In many sewage farms on the continent of Europe, the number
<!--618.png--><span class="pagenum">584</span>treated
per acre varies between 80 and 200 persons; for example, at
Breslau it is 187, at Berlin 105, at Brunswick 88, and at Steglitz 185.</p>

<p>Regarding the crops to be grown on the land, very satisfactory results
were obtained from growing Indian corn, and two excellent crops per
annum were taken from an area of 500 acres during the period in which
the writer was responsible for the works. It was also his intention to
grow alfalfa, and turn a part of the land into a pecan grove, and,
although he does not share the apprehensions of danger of either Mr.
Pitkethly or Mr. Hammond as to growing root crops, he believes the
growth of alfalfa, Indian corn, oats, barley, and pecan and fruit trees
is eminently suitable for the land, which is a deep rich loam, from 4 to
8 ft. deep, overlying the "sillar" formation referred to in the paper.
The writer has seen many sewage farms during the last 18 years, upon
which root crops of excellent quality have been grown, and not the least
suspicion has ever been raised regarding their use.</p>

<p>In reference to the adoption of the monolithic form for constructing the
South Reservoir, the writer is so convinced as to its economy that had
he to build this reservoir again, he would adopt the same method. Mr.
Binckley, in drawing attention to the method of construction, has
overlooked the fact that the cost of forms for a reservoir 30 ft. deep
was a very serious item, and warranted the adoption of this new method,
not only on account of economy but because of rapidity of construction;
while, in the case of the Obispado Reservoir, which is very much
shallower, simpler forms could be and were adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Saucedo's remarks regarding the repetition of the extraordinary
floods of August, 1909, in September, 1910, are particularly
interesting, and show how abnormal conditions are in so dry a section of
Mexico as the State of Nuevo León. These two floods, the writer
believes, are among the most instructive in North America, particularly
when one remembers that prior to 1909 the average rainfall during a
period of 15 years, was less than 22 in. per annum.</p>

<p>Table 18, compiled by the writer, shows how very extreme the floods of
1909 were compared with those on other rivers, while those of 1910,
referred to by Mr. Saucedo, although not so great, would appear to have
reached a rate of flow of about 300 cu. ft. per sec. per sq. mile of the
drainage area.</p>

<p>The writer agrees with Mr. Saucedo that in the semi-arid regions of
Mexico and the Southern States, and also in India, the possibility of
these abnormal floods is an important consideration in the design of
hydraulic works.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
